Solution

A sparse vector is a vector that has mostly zero values, while a dense vector is a vector where most of the elements are non-zero. It is inefficient to store a sparse vector as a one-dimensional array (Approach 1). Instead, we can store the non-zero values and their corresponding indices in a dictionary, with the index being the key (Approach 2). Alternatively, we can represent elements of a sparse vector as an array of pairs for each non-zero value. Each pair has an integer index and a numerical value (Approach 3).

Approach 1: Non-efficient Array Approach
Intuition

We ignore the sparsity of the array and store the original array.
Algorithm
Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of the input array.

    Time complexity: O(n) for both constructing the sparse vector and calculating the dot product.

    Space complexity: O(1) for constructing the sparse vector as we simply save a reference to the input array and O(1) for calculating the dot product.

Approach 2: Hash Table
Intuition

Store the non-zero values and their corresponding indices in a dictionary, with the index being the key. Any index that is not present corresponds to a value 0 in the input array.
Algorithm
Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of the input array and L be the number of non-zero elements.

    Time complexity: O(n) for creating the Hash Map; O(L) for calculating the dot product.

    Space complexity: O(L) for creating the Hash Map, as we only store elements that are non-zero. O(1) for calculating the dot product.

Approach 3: Index-Value Pairs
Intuition

We can also represent elements of a sparse vector as a list of <index, value> pairs. We use two pointers to iterate through the two vectors to calculate the dot product.
Algorithm
Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of the input array and L and L2​ be the number of non-zero elements for the two vectors.

    Time complexity: O(n) for creating the <index, value> pair for non-zero values; O(L+L2​) for calculating the dot product.

    Space complexity: O(L) for creating the <index, value> pairs for non-zero values. O(1) for calculating the dot product.
