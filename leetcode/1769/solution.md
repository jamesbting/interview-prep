Solution
Overview
We are given a binary string called boxes. Each element in this string represents a box:

0 means the box is empty,
1 means the box contains one ball.
In each operation, we can move a ball to any adjacent box (either to the left or right). Multiple balls can be in the same box at the same time, and we need to figure out how many operations are needed to move all balls to each box.

Note: The calculation of answer for each index is done considering the initial state of the boxes array.

Approach 1: Brute Force
Intuition
Given that the number of boxes is bounded by 2000, we can use brute force techniques to solve this problem. This involves calculating the total number of operations for each box individually and storing the results in an array.

First, we go through all the boxes to check if a box contains a ball. If a box has a ball, we then calculate how many operations are needed to move that ball to the current box by iterating through all other boxes. The number of operations needed to move a ball from one box to another is based on the distance between their positions. This is simply the absolute difference between the indices of the two boxes.

Next, we add up the differences for all the balls and keep a running total of the operations required for each box. These totals are stored in an answer array, which holds the result for each box. Finally, after processing all boxes, we return the answer array.

Algorithm
Initialize the Result Array:

Create an array answer of size equal to the length of the input string boxes and initialize all elements to 0.
Iterate Through Each Box:

Loop through the boxes using an index variable currentBox.
Check for Balls in the Current Box:

If the current box contains a ball (i.e., boxes.charAt(currentBox) == '1'):
Iterate through all other boxes using an index variable newPosition.
For each box, calculate the distance to the currentBox using the absolute difference Math.abs(newPosition - currentBox).
Add this distance to answer[newPosition].
Return the Result:

After processing all boxes, return the answer array.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the size of the string boxes.

Time Complexity: O(n 
2
 )

The algorithm iterates through each box, and for each box containing a ball, it iterates through all other boxes to calculate the distances. This results in a nested loop structure with n iterations for both the outer and inner loops, leading to a total time complexity of O(n 
2
 ).

Space Complexity: O(1)

We use an answer array to store the result. However, since this array is part of the output defined by the problem, it is not considered in the space complexity analysis. Therefore, the overall space complexity remains O(1).

Approach 2: Sum of Left and Right Moves
Intuition
From the previous approach, observe that a ball can move in only one direction: either left or right. If the target box is to the left of the ball, it will move left. If the target box is to the right of the ball, it will move right. So, for each box, some balls will come from the left side, and others will come from the right side.

To calculate the distances for all the balls coming from the left in just one pass, we use a combined approach within a single loop. As we iterate through the boxes from left to right, we keep track of how many balls we’ve encountered so far using the variable ballsToLeft. Each time we move to the next box, the distance for all the balls we’ve passed increases by one. So, the total number of operations for those balls increases by the number of balls we've encountered up to that point. We also keep track of the cumulative number of moves using the variable movesToLeft.

Similarly, we calculate the distances for the balls coming from the right by iterating through the boxes from right to left. This is achieved using the variable ballsToRight to track how many balls we’ve encountered, and movesToRight to track the cumulative moves. During this reverse pass, we simultaneously calculate and accumulate the number of moves required for balls coming from the right.

In each iteration, we update the answer array by adding the moves calculated from both the left and right sides. The value for each box in answer[i] (for the left pass) and answer[j] (for the right pass) represents the total moves required for balls to reach that box.

At the end of the loop, the answer array will contain the total number of moves for each box, and we return this array.

Algorithm
Initialize n as the length of the boxes string and create an array answer to store the result.

Initialize variables ballsToLeft, movesToLeft, ballsToRight, and movesToRight to track the number of balls and the moves required to move balls to the left and right, respectively.

Single pass through the string boxes:

For each index i:
Left pass (first half of the loop):

Add the current number of moves to the left (movesToLeft) to the corresponding index in the answer array.
Update ballsToLeft by adding the number of balls in the current box.
Update movesToLeft by adding ballsToLeft (total balls to the left) to account for the moves required for the next balls.
Right pass (second half of the loop):

Calculate the corresponding index j for the right pass (n - 1 - i).
Add the current number of moves to the right (movesToRight) to the corresponding index in the answer array.
Update ballsToRight by adding the number of balls in the current box.
Update movesToRight by adding ballsToRight (total balls to the right) to account for the moves required for the next balls.
Return the answer array containing the minimum number of operations for each box.

Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the size of the string boxes.

Time Complexity: O(n)

The algorithm uses a single loop that iterates over the string boxes once. Within this loop, it performs constant-time operations such as accessing characters, updating variables, and updating the answer array. Since the loop runs n times, the overall time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity: O(1)

We use a few integer variables (ballsToLeft, movesToLeft, ballsToRight, movesToRight), all of which require constant space. Additionally, we use an answer array to store the result. However, since this array is part of the output defined by the problem, it is not considered in the space complexity analysis. Therefore, the overall space complexity remains O(1).
