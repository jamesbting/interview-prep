Solution
Overview

Tic Tac Toe is one of the classic games with pretty simple rules. Two players take turns placing characters on an n by n board. The first player that connects n consecutive characters horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. Traditionally (and in this problem), the board width is fixed at 3. However, to help demonstrate the efficiency of each approach, we will refer to the board width as n throughout this article.

In this problem, we are looking to determine the winner of the game (if one exists). If neither player has won, then we must determine if the game is ongoing or if it has ended in a draw.

The most intuitive approach is to check, after each move, if the current player has won, which can be implemented by different methods. Here we introduce two approaches to solve this problem, the first one is the most intuitive one, while the second one has some optimization.

Approach 1: Brute Force

Intuition

Since we have to find if the current player has won, let's take a look at what the winning conditions are. The figure below illustrates the 4 winning conditions according to the rules.

limits

The above diagram shows that a player can win by connecting n consecutive characters in a row, column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal.

Then, how do we check if any player has won so far?

limits

We can start by creating an n by n grid that represents the original board.

Next, let's take a closer look at the previous winning conditions. Notice that a character located at [row, col] will be on the diagonal when its column index equals its row index, that is row = col. Likewise, a character will be on the anti-diagonal when then the sum of its row index and column index is equal to n - 1, that is row + col = n - 1.

Suppose the current player marks the location [row, col], where row and col stand for the row index and column index on board, respectively. If row row or column col has n characters from the same player after this move, then the current player wins.

Now, after each move, we can determine if a player has won by checking each row, column, and diagonal. The next question is, how will we determine the result after all moves have been made? We need to find a way to handle cases where neither player wins.

limits

If neither player has won after all of the moves have been played, we need to check the length of moves. There are two possibilities: "Draw" if the board is full, meaning the length of moves is n * n, or "Pending" otherwise.

Now, we are ready to implement a brute force solution.

Algorithm

    Initialize a 2-dimensional array board of size n by n representing an empty board.

    For each new move [row, col], mark the relative position board[row][col] on board with the player's id. Suppose player one's id is 1, and player two's id is -1.

    Then, check if this move meets any of the winning conditions:
        Check if all cells in the current row are filled with characters from the current player. We traverse the row from column 0 to column n - 1 while keeping the row index constant.
        Check if all cells in the current column are filled with characters from the current player. We traverse the column from row 0 to row n - 1 while keeping the column index constant.
        Check if this move is on the diagonal; that is, check if row equals col. If so, traverse the entire diagonal and check if all positions on the diagonal contain characters from this player.
        Check if this move is on the anti-diagonal; that is, check if row + col equals n - 1. If so, traverse the entire anti-diagonal and check if all positions on the anti-diagonal contain characters from this player.

    If there is no winner after all of the moves have been played, we will check if the entire board is filled. If so, return "Draw", otherwise return "Pending", meaning the game is still on. That is, check if the length of moves equals the number of cells on the n by n board.

Implementation

Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of the board and m be the length of input moves.

    Time complexity: O(mâ‹…n)

    For every move, we need to traverse the same row, column, diagonal, and anti-diagonal, which takes O(n) time.

    Space complexity: O(n2)

    We use an n by n array to record every move.


Approach 2: Record Each Move

Intuition

Instead of recording each move in a n by n grid, as we did in the first approach, could we find a more effective way to record the previous moves?
The answer is Yes.

    Let's take a look at the 4 winning conditions again.

limits

In the first approach, since we created the board and recorded each move, we had to traverse the entire line to check if all marks were of the same type.

    However, this method stores way more information than we actually need, it also results in an increased time and space complexity.

We do not need to know where these marks are located in order to solve the problem. What we do need to know is: after move [row, col], does any row, column, or diagonal meet the winning condition?

    Therefore, we could just record the result of each row and column instead of the position of each move precisely.

Now the question becomes: How should we record the result? Let's take a look at the figure below to find out.

limits

    Notice that there are many unique ways to fill a single row. However, only two cases are considered as a win. Recall that in the first approach, we set the value of players A and B to 1 and -1, respectively. Here we can take advantage of these distinct values again.

Suppose we let the value of player A equal 1 and the value of player B equal -1. There are other ways to assign value, but 1 and -1 are the most convenient.

Therefore, a player will win if the value of any line equals n or -n. Thus after a move [row, col], we could calculate the value of row row and column col and check if the absolute value equals n. If this move is placed on the diagonal or the anti-diagonal, then we will check if the absolute value of the relative value equals n as well.

Thus, we just need to build two arrays to represent the values for each row and column. For instance, rows = [0, 0, 0], represents the initial value of row_1, row_2, and row_3, and the two values diag and anti_diag for value on diagonal and anti-diagonal.

To see how this will work, consider the two example moves shown below.

limits

After player A plays at [2, 0], we update the value of rows[2] and col[0], since row = 2 and col = 2. Also, because row + col = 2, we will update the value of the anti-diagonal. Since none of these values equals 3 after the update, this means that the game is still on.

After player B's move, we update the value of row[1] and col[1]. Since this character is on both diagonal and anti-diagonal, we update diag and anti_diag as well. We will see that col[1] = -3, which means the current player (player B) has won the game! Thus return B.

Algorithm

    We use two lists, rows and cols of size n, to represent each row and column. We also use two numbers, diag and anti_diag, to represent the diagonal value and anti-diagonal value, respectively.

    Set the value of player A as 1 and the value of player B as -1.

    For each new move [row, col], add the player's value to rows[row] and cols[col]. If [row, col] is on the diagonal or anti-diagonal, then add the player's value to diag or anti_diag as well.

    Then, check if this move meets any winning condition:
        Check if all cells in the current row contain characters from this player. To do so, we just need to check if the absolute value of rows[row] equals n.
        Check if all cells in the current column contain characters from this player. To do so, we just need to check if the absolute value of cols[col] equals n.
        Check if this move is on the diagonal; that is if row equals col. If so, check if the absolute value of diag equals n.
        Check if this move is on the anti-diagonal; that is if row + col equals n - 1. If so, check if the absolute value of anti_diag equals n.

    If there is no winner after all of the moves have been played, we will check if the entire board is filled. If so, return "Draw", otherwise return "Pending", meaning the game is still on. To determine if the entire board is filled, check if the length of moves equals the number of cells on the n by n board.

Implementation

Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of the board and m be the length of input moves.

    Time complexity: O(m)

    For every move, we update the value for a row, column, diagonal, and anti-diagonal. Each update takes constant time. We also check if any of these lines satisfies the winning condition which also takes constant time.

    Space complexity: O(n)

    We use two arrays of size n to record the value for each row and column, and two integers of constant space to record to value for diagonal and anti-diagonal.
