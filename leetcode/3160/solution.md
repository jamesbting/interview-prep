Overview
Our task is to return an array listing the number of distinct colors after each query. Note that in this case, distinct means the number of total colors. It does not mean that the color only appears one time.

Let's look at an example of a potential set of queries:

Current

In this problem, two main scenarios can occur at each query:

Uncolored Ball - adding a color to a ball that did not already have a color
Colored Ball - adding a color to an already colored ball, replacing the previous color on the ball with the new color
Approach 1: Hashmap and Array
Intuition
When approaching this problem, the main challenge is efficiently tracking and updating the colors of the balls after each query.

To solve this problem, we'll need to track both the number of times each color appears, and the number of distinct colors.

Let's consider the two different scenarios that occur when a query is applied to a ball. If the ball is:

Uncolored: the count of the newly assigned color is increased.
Colored: the count of the new color is increased and the count of the previously assigned color decreases.
Whether or not the number of distinct colors is impacted will depend on the total number of balls of that color already present.

A hashmap can be used for this purpose since it efficiently associates counts with specific colors.

We also need to track the current color of each ball because the problem involves overwriting existing colors. A straightforward solution is to use an array to store the color of each ball, where the index represents the ball and the value at that index represents the current color of the ball.

With these data structures in place, we can now proceed to process the queries. For each query, we update the color of the ball and adjust the count of distinct colors accordingly. As we process each query, we maintain the color count and track the balls' colors.

However, this solution ultimately fails due to exceeding the memory limit allowed for this problem.

Algorithm
Initialize:
an integer n, equal to the length of queries.
an array result of length n, where result[i] denotes the number of distinct colors after the ith query.
an array ballArray, which stores the distinct ball labels found when traversing queries and the current colors associated with them.
A hash map colorMap, which stores the number of distinct colors after processing the current query.
Iterate from index 0 to n - 1 to traverse the queries. For each query, query[i]:
Initialize:
an integer ball equal to query[i][0], denoting the current ball that will be colored.
an integer color equal to query[i][1], denoting the color that the ball will be colored.
If ballArray[ball] is not 0, meaning the ball is already colored:
Check the existing color of ball, which will be labeled prevColor.
Decrement the count of prevColor in colorMap.
If the count becomes 0, remove prevColor from colorMap.
Update ballArray[ball] to color.
Increase the count of color in colorMap by one.
Set result[i] to the size of colorMap.
Return the result array.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the number of queries and m be the limit.

Time Complexity: O(n)

The algorithm iterates through each query exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each query.

Specifically, for each query, it checks and updates the ballArray and colorMap, both of which are O(1) operations due to the use of a hash map (colorMap) and an array (ballArray).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear in the number of queries, O(n).

Note: The operations on the colorMap (such as get, put, and remove) are considered O(1) on average due to the nature of hash maps.

Space Complexity: O(m+n)

The space complexity is determined by the ballArray and the colorMap. The ballArray has a size of m+1 (since it stores the color of each ball up to the limit m), and the colorMap can store up to n distinct colors in the worst case (if all queries introduce a new color). Therefore, the space complexity is O(m+n).

Note: The result array also contributes O(n) space, but since it is part of the output, it is typically not counted in the auxiliary space complexity. However, if we include it, the space complexity remains O(m+n).

Approach 2: Two Hash Maps
Intuition
The main challenge from the previous solution is identifying and addressing areas where large amounts of memory are used.

A significant portion of our memory usage comes from the array of size limit + 1. When we look at the constraints, we can see that the value of limit can be extremely large, with the range 1 <= limit <= 10^9. Contrarily, the queries only range from 1 <= n <= 10^5, where n is the length of queries. As we navigate through the queries, we can see that not all of the ball labels are guaranteed to be accessed by the queries, leading to unnecessary memory usage.

We can improve our storage efficiency by eliminating wasted space. Here, we need to choose a data structure that only allocates space as needed. Similar to how the colors are stored, we can utilize a hash map to store only the necessary labels accessed by the queries. By doing so, we can optimize the space complexity and prevent memory overuse.

After making this adjustment, we can apply the same logic and procedure as the previous solution. With this space optimization, we can process and track the results from the queries while staying within the memory limit.

Algorithm
Initialize:
an integer n, equal to the length of queries.
an array result of length n, where result[i] denotes the number of distinct colors after the ith query.
two hash maps:
colorMap, which stores the number of distinct colors after processing current query.
ballMap, which stores the distinct ball labels found when traversing queries and the current colors associated with them.
Iterate from index 0 to n-1 to traverse the queries. For each query, query[i]:
Initialize:
an integer ball equal to query[i][0], denoting the current ball that will be colored.
an integer color equal to query[i][1], denoting the color that the ball will be colored.
If ball already exists in ballMap, meaning it is already colored:
Check the existing color of ball, which will be labeled prevColor.
Decrement the count of prevColor in colorMap.
If the count becomes 0, remove prevColor from colorMap.
Update ballMap[ball] to color.
Increase the count of color in colorMap by one.
Set result[i] to the current size of colorMap.
Return the result array.

Space Complexity: O(n)

The space complexity is determined by the ballMap and the colorMap.

In the worst case, ballMap can store up to n distinct colors (if all queries introduce a new ball label), and the colorMap can store up to n distinct colors (if all queries introduce a new color). Therefore, the space complexity is O(2n), which simplifies to O(n).

Note: The result array also contributes O(n) space, but since it is part of the output, it is typically not counted in the auxiliary space complexity. However, if we include it, the space complexity remains O(n).
