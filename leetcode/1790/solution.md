Solution
Overview

We are given two strings s1 and s2 and want to determine if it is possible to make the strings equal by performing at most one string swap on one of the strings. A string swap involves choosing any two indices in the string and swapping the characters at these positions.
Approach 1: Frequency Map + Check Differences
Intuition

To start, consider the example where s1 = "bank" and s2 = "kanb". If we swap the first and last characters of s1, we get "kanb", which matches s2. Alternatively, we could swap the first and last characters of s2 to get "bank", which matches s1. One observation we can make is that this swapping only works if the two strings share the same characters and frequencies. The only difference would be the ordering of characters.

In other words, it is necessary for the two strings to be anagrams for a string swap to be possible. Otherwise, one string will have a certain character that the other is missing, and no amount of swapping can make them equal.

However, two strings being anagrams is not enough to ensure swapping will make them equal. Let's consider another example: s1 = hello and s2 = olleh. We know that the two strings are anagrams, but it is still not possible for a single string swap to make s1 equal to s2 or vice versa. If we were to compare each character of s1, s1[i], to its corresponding character in s2, s2[i], we see that there is a total of 4 differences at indices i = 0, 1, 3, 4. One string swap can only resolve two differences, so they cannot be made equal. This leads us to our second requirement for a string swap to be possible: If there are any differences, the total number of character-by-character differences has to be exactly 2. Note the edge case where s1 and s2 are already equal, in which there are 0 character-by-character differences and no string swaps are needed.

Now, we have fully developed a rule for determining if the two strings can be made equal:

    If s1 and s2 are already equal, then no string swap is needed and we know it's trivially possible for the strings to be equal.
    If s1 and s2 have the same set of character frequencies (i.e. are anagrams) and have exactly 2 character-by-character differences, then we know it's possible to make the strings equal with 1 string swap.
    Otherwise, the two strings can't be made equal with one string swap.

To implement these checks, we can use two frequency maps s1FrequencyMap and s2FrequencyMap to keep track of the frequency of each letter for the two strings. As we go through the characters of the two strings and populate the frequency maps, we can also maintain counter numDiffs that counts the number of differences at corresponding indices. If the two strings are anagrams and numDiffs equals 2, we know that one swap can resolve the differences.
Algorithm

    Check edge case: if s1 and s2 are already equal, then return true.
    Initialize the frequency maps for each string: s1FrequencyMap and s2FrequencyMap are character arrays of size 26.
    Initialize the counter numDiffs to maintain the number of character differences between the two strings.
    Iterate through the characters of s1 and s2:
        Let s1Char and s2Char be the current characters of s1 and s2, respectively.
        If s1Char != s2Char, then increment numDiffs. If numDiffs is now greater than 2, then we know one string swap will not make the strings equal, so return false.
        Update the frequency maps by incrementing the frequency of s1Char and s2Char: s1FrequencyMap[s1Char]++ and s2FrequencyMap[s2Char]++.
    Now, the strings are equal only if the frequency maps are equal (at this point, we know numDiffs is exactly 2): If s1FrequencyMap and s2FrequencyMap have the same frequencies, then return true. Otherwise, return false.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let N be the length of s1 and s2.

    Time Complexity: O(N)

    Iterating through s1 and s2 takes O(N) time. For each character we iterate, updating the frequency maps and diff counter takes O(1) constant time. Thus, the total time complexity is O(N).

    Space Complexity: O(1)

    Each frequency map has a fixed size of 26, regardless of the length of s1 and s2. Thus, the space complexity is O(1) constant time.

Approach 2: Only Check Differences
Intuition

For our previous approach, we already achieved an efficient constant space complexity. However, let's try to optimize further and see if we can check if the two strings can be made equal without using the frequency maps.

Let's take another look at the example s1 = bank and s2 = kanb. We previously established that there are exactly 2 character differences: at index 0 and index 3. This makes it possible for one string swap to make the strings equal.

However, we can make a more specific observation: This swap only works because the character at index 0 of s1 matches the character at index 3 of s2. Similarly, the character at index 3 for s1 is equal to the character at index 0 for s2. In other words, if the characters in the mismatched positions "cross-match", a swap will be able to make the strings equal.

Swap matching

This leads us to a stricter rule:

    For the strings to be equal after a single swap, there must be exactly two mismatched indices, i and j, such that:
        s1[i] == s2[j]
        s1[j] == s2[i]

Similar to before, if the strings are already identical, no swap is needed. In all other cases, equality is not possible.

For this rule, we can simply introduce two new variables firstIndexDiff and secondIndexDiff to keep track of the indices of differences. We continue to use numDiffs to make sure the numDiffs doesn't surpass 2. We will iterate through s1 and s2 like we do in approach 1, except we now update firstIndexDiff, secondIndexDiff, and numDiffs when we see a character difference.

    Note: For this approach's implementation, observe that we do not have to explicitly check the trivial edge case where s1 and s2 are equal. If the two strings are equal, then no diffs are found, and s1[firstIndexDiff] == s2[secondIndexDiff] && s1[secondIndexDiff] == s2[firstIndexDiff] will always be true, assuming the default initialized values of firstIndexDiff and secondIndexDiff are valid (they can just be 0).

Algorithm

    Initialize firstIndexDiff, secondIndexDiff, and numDiffs all to 0.
    Iterate through the characters of s1 and s2:
        Let s1Char and s2Char be the current characters of s1 and s2 at index i, respectively.
        If s1Char != s2Char:
            Increment numDiffs.
            If numDiffs is now greater than 2, then we know one string swap will not make the strings equal, so return false.
            If numDiffs is now equal to 1, then we have found our first difference: assign firstIndexDiff = i.
            Otherwise, numDiffs is 2 so we have found our second difference: assign secondIndexDiff = i.
    Return s1[firstIndexDiff] == s2[secondIndexDiff] && s1[secondIndexDiff] == s2[firstIndexDiff]

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

    Time Complexity: O(N)

    Iterating through s1 and s2 takes O(N) time. For each character we iterate, updating numDiffs, firstIndexDiff, secondIndexDiff takes O(1) constant time. Thus, the total time complexity is O(N).

    Space Complexity: O(1)

    We only use 3 integer variables, so the space complexity is constant O(1).
