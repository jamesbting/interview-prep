Approach 1: List operation
Algorithm

Iterate over all the elements in nums
If some number in nums is new to array, append it
If some number is already in the array, remove it

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n 
2
 ). We iterate through nums, taking O(n) time. We search the whole list to find whether there is duplicate number, taking O(n) time. Because search is in the for loop, so we have to multiply both time complexities which is O(n 
2
 ).

Space complexity : O(n). We need a list of size n to contain elements in nums.



Approach 2: Hash Table
Algorithm

We use hash table to avoid the O(n) time required for searching the elements.

Iterate through all elements in nums and set up key/value pair.
Return the element which appeared only once.

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n⋅1)=O(n). Time complexity of for loop is O(n). Time complexity of hash table(dictionary in python) operation pop is O(1).

Space complexity : O(n). The space required by hash_table is equal to the number of elements in nums.



Approach 3: Math
Concept

2∗(a+b+c)−(a+a+b+b+c)=c


Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n+n)=O(n). sum will call next to iterate through nums.
We can see it as sum(list(i, for i in nums)) which means the time complexity is O(n) because of the number of elements(n) in nums.

Space complexity : O(n+n)=O(n). set needs space for the elements in nums



Approach 4: Bit Manipulation
Concept

If we take XOR of zero and some bit, it will return that bit
a⊕0=a
If we take XOR of two same bits, it will return 0
a⊕a=0
a⊕b⊕a=(a⊕a)⊕b=0⊕b=b
So we can XOR all bits together to find the unique number.


Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n). We only iterate through nums, so the time complexity is the number of elements in nums.

Space complexity : O(1).
