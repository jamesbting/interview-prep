Approach: Left Join on ID
Algorithm

To combine employee names with their unique ids and get the related data from two DataFrames, let's merge employees and employee_uni based on the common column id. This can be implemented using the merge() function in Pandas. Note that we need to set some parameters in merge:

    employees and employee_uni: these are the two DataFrames that we want to merge.
    on='id', this specifies the column on which the merge operation will be performed. Both DataFrames contain the column id.
    how='left': this defines the type of merge to be performed. The left merge means that all the rows from the employees DataFrame will be included in the result, and any matching rows from the employee_uni DataFrame will also be included. Hence, employees without unique IDs will also be retained, but their corresponding columns from employee_uni will be filled with NaN (Not a Number) values.

employee_name_uni = pd.merge(employees, employee_uni, on='id', how='left')

This creates the employee_name_uni DataFrame as shown below, where all the rows from employees are preserved and additional information from employee_uni is included for the matching id values. For rows that don't have a matching id in employee_uni, the corresponding columns from employee_uni are filled with NaN.
id	name	unique_id
1	Alice	NaN
7	Bob	NaN
11	Meir	2.0
90	Winston	3.0
3	Jonathan	1.0

The merged information from two DataFrames contains the name and unique_id for each employee (if they have one). Next, we will create a new DataFrame containing only the required columns unique_id and name, which can be accomplished by selecting the columns unique_id and name from the employee_name_uni DataFrame using double square brackets.

answer = employee_name_uni[['unique_id', 'name']]

We will obtain the DataFrame answer as follows:
unique_id	name
null	Alice
null	Bob
2	Meir
3	Winston
1	Jonathan

Approach: Left Join on ID
Algorithm

We first perform a LEFT JOIN operation to combine data from both tables based on the id column. Similarly, we use LEFT JOIN to ensure that all the rows from the Employees table are included in the result, even if there are no matching rows in the EmployeeUNI table.

SELECT 
    * 
FROM
    Employees 
LEFT JOIN 
    EmployeeUNI 
ON 
    Employees.id = EmployeeUNI.id;

id	name	id	unique_id
1	Alice	null	null
7	Bob	null	null
11	Meir	11	2
90	Winston	90	3
3	Jonathan	3	1

Since we want to retrieve the columns unique_id and name from the combined table, we will select the unique_id column from the EmployeeUNI table and the name column from the Employees table. The complete code is as follows:
Implementation

SELECT 
    EmployeeUNI.unique_id, Employees.name
FROM 
    Employees
LEFT JOIN 
    EmployeeUNI 
ON 
    Employees.id = EmployeeUNI.id;
