Approach #1: Recursion [Accepted]

Intuition

Prune children of the tree recursively. The only decisions at each node are whether to prune the left child or the right child.

Algorithm

We'll use a function containsOne(node) that tells us whether the subtree at this node contains a 1, and prunes all subtrees that do not contain 1.

If for example, node.left subtree does not contain a one, then we should prune it via node.left = null.

Also, the parent needs to be checked. If for example the tree is a single node 0, the answer is an empty tree.

Complexity Analysis

    Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We process each node once.

    Space Complexity: O(N), the recursion call stack can be as large as the height H of the tree. In the worst case scenario, H=N, when the tree is skewed.
