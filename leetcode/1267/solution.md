Solution
Overview
We are given a grid representing a server center in the form of a matrix of size m x n. Each cell of the matrix contains either a 1, indicating the presence of a server, or a 0, indicating an empty space.

We need to return the number of servers that can communicate with at least one other server. This excludes servers that are isolated, i.e., those that do not share a row or column with any other server.

The first thing to note is that a server can communicate with another server if they are located either in the same row or the same column. Thus, the key observation here is that we only need to check rows and columns to determine if a server is communicable. If there’s at least one other server in the same row or column, then this server is communicable.

Approach 1: Brute-Force
Intuition
We know that each cell either contains a server (represented by 1) or is empty (represented by 0). So, we start by going through each cell to see if there is a server at that position. If the current cell contains a server, we then check if this server can communicate with any other server. If it can, we count it as communicable.

Once we find a server, we check if there is any other server in the same row that can communicate with it. We do this by iterating through all the other cells in the same row. If we find another server in the same row, we can immediately mark it as communicable.

If we do not find any other server in the row, we proceed to check the column. We iterate through all the other rows in the same column to see if there is another server. If a server is found in the same column, we know this server can communicate and is communicable.

As soon as we determine that a server can communicate (either in the same row or column), we increment the total communicable servers count. Once we finish checking the entire grid, we return the count of communicable servers.

Algorithm
Initialize numRows and numCols to represent the number of rows and columns in the grid.

Initialize communicableServersCount to 0, which will keep track of the count of communicable servers.

Traverse through the grid:

For each server at position (row, col) where grid[row][col] == 1:
Set canCommunicate to false.
Check for communication in the same row:
Iterate through each column otherCol in the same row:
If otherCol is not equal to col and grid[row][otherCol] == 1, set canCommunicate to true and break the loop.
If canCommunicate is true, increment communicableServersCount.
If no communication was found in the same row, check for communication in the same column:
Iterate through each row otherRow in the same column:
If otherRow is not equal to row and grid[otherRow][col] == 1, set canCommunicate to true and break the loop.
If canCommunicate is true, increment communicableServersCount.
Return communicableServersCount, the total count of servers that can communicate.

Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let m be the number of rows and n be the number of columns in the grid.

Time complexity: O(m⋅n⋅(m+n))

The algorithm traverses through each cell in the grid using nested loops, where the outer loop runs m times (for each row) and the inner loop runs n times (for each column). For each cell containing a server (grid[row][col] == 1), it performs two additional checks:

It checks the entire row to see if there is another server in the same row. This involves iterating over n columns.
If no server is found in the same row, it checks the entire column to see if there is another server in the same column. This involves iterating over m rows.
Since these checks are performed for each server, the worst-case time complexity is O(m⋅n⋅(m+n)).

Space complexity: O(1)

The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, as it only maintains a few variables (numRows, numCols, communicableServersCount, canCommunicate, etc.). No additional data structures are used that scale with the input size. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).

Approach 2: Track Using Two Arrays
Intuition
To optimize the checking process, the first step is to count how many servers exist in each row and each column before we start checking individual servers.

We don’t need to check the entire row and column every time for every server. Instead, we can track the number of servers in each row and column using two arrays: rowCounts and colCounts. We loop over the grid once, and for each server (grid[row][col] == 1), we increment the count for the corresponding row and column. This precomputes how many servers are present in each row and column.

The advantage of this approach is that we know in advance how many servers are in a given row or column, so when we encounter a server, we can quickly determine if it’s communicable by checking these precomputed values.

Once we have the counts of servers in each row and column, the next task is to identify which servers are communicable. For a server at position (row, col), we need to check:

If the row has more than one server (i.e., rowCounts[row] > 1), which means there are other servers in the same row.
If the column has more than one server (i.e., colCounts[col] > 1), which means there are other servers in the same column.
If either condition is true, the server can communicate, and we increment the count of communicable servers.

Once we’ve checked all servers and counted the communicable ones, we simply return the count.

Algorithm
Initialize two arrays, rowCounts and colCounts, of appropriate sizes to keep track of the server counts in each row and column.

Count servers in each row and column:

Iterate through each row (row), and for each row, iterate through each column (col):
If there’s a server at grid[row][col], increment the corresponding values in rowCounts[row] and colCounts[col].
Initialize communicableServersCount to 0, which will store the count of servers that can communicate.

Count servers that can communicate (i.e., those in the same row or column as another server):

Iterate again through each row and column:
If there’s a server at grid[row][col], check if it can communicate with another server (i.e., if rowCounts[row] > 1 or colCounts[col] > 1).
If so, increment communicableServersCount.
Return communicableServersCount, the total count of servers that can communicate.

Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let m be the number of rows and n be the number of columns in the grid.

Time complexity: O(m⋅n)

The first nested loop iterates over each row in the grid to count the number of servers in each row and column. The outer loop runs m times (for each row), and the inner loop runs n times (for each column). This results in a time complexity of O(m⋅n).

The second nested loop also iterates over each row in the grid to determine if a server can communicate with others in its row or column. This again involves an outer loop running m times and an inner loop running n times, resulting in a time complexity of O(m⋅n).

Since both loops are independent and each has a time complexity of O(m⋅n), the overall time complexity is O(m⋅n).

Space complexity: O(m+n)

The algorithm uses two additional arrays:
- rowCounts of size n (number of columns) to store the count of servers in each column.
- colCounts of size m (number of rows) to store the count of servers in each row.

The space required for these arrays is O(m+n).

The space used by the input grid is not counted towards the space complexity as it is part of the input.

Approach 3: Server Grouping
Intuition
In Approach 2, we were repeatedly scanning the entire row and column for each server to check if there were any other servers for communication. While this method works, it is somewhat redundant since we perform the same checks multiple times. The goal now is to micro-optimize the process.

Instead of directly checking the count of servers in every row and column each time we find a server, we aim to track the necessary information during our first pass so that in the second pass, we can make decisions more quickly. This will reduce some runtime redundancy.

We begin by initializing a rowCounts array, where each entry tracks the number of servers in that row. By maintaining this count, we can easily find if a server can communicate based on the number of servers in the same row.

In addition to counting the servers in each row and column, we use another array, lastServerInCol, to track the position of the last server in each column. This is crucial because if a column has multiple servers, we don’t need to check the entire column again. Instead, we can focus on whether the last server in a column is part of a communicable set (i.e., a row or column with multiple servers). For example, if lastServerInCol[0] is 3, it means the last server in column 0 is at row 3. If this server can communicate, it indicates that there are other servers in that column, and we can mark it as communicable without needing to scan all rows again.

Now we process each server in the grid by iterating over the rows and columns. For each server we encounter, we:

Increment the count for that row in the rowCounts array.
Track the position of the last server in the lastServerInCol array.
Thus, we gather all the necessary information about how many servers are in each row and column and the position of the last server.

After collecting this information, we use the rowCounts and lastServerInCol arrays to identify communicable servers. For each server in the grid, we check if the count of servers in the same row is greater than 1. If it is, we know that this server can communicate with another server in the same row. Similarly, we check if the server’s column has more than one server using the lastServerInCol array. If the server is part of a communicable set (i.e., there are other servers in the same row or column), we increase the count of communicable servers.

The algorithm is visualized below:

Current

Algorithm
Initialize communicableServersCount to 0 to keep track of servers that can communicate.
Initialize rowCounts to store the count of servers in each row, and lastServerInCol to track the last server in each column.
First Pass: Count servers in each row and column
Iterate through each row (row):
For each row, initialize serverCountInRow to 0 to track the number of servers in that row.
Iterate through each column (col):
If a server is found at grid[row][col], increment serverCountInRow, update rowCounts[col], and set lastServerInCol[col] to row.
If the row has more than one server, increment communicableServersCount by the number of servers in the row and set lastServerInCol[col] to -1 (indicating no servers to communicate in that column).
Second Pass: Check if servers can communicate
Iterate again through each column (col):
If there is a server at lastServerInCol[col] and the count of servers in the corresponding row (rowCounts[lastServerInCol[col]]) is greater than one, increment communicableServersCount by 1.
Finally, return communicableServersCount, the total count of servers that can communicate.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let m be the number of rows and n be the number of columns in the grid.

Time complexity: O(m⋅n)

The algorithm performs two passes over the grid. In the first pass, it iterates over each cell in the grid to count the number of servers in each row and column. This involves nested loops where the outer loop runs m times (for each row) and the inner loop runs n times (for each column). This results in a time complexity of O(m⋅n).

The second pass iterates over the rows to check if servers can communicate based on the counts computed in the first pass. This pass runs in O(m) time. Since O(m⋅n) dominates O(m), the overall time complexity is O(m⋅n).

Space complexity: O(m+n)

The algorithm uses two additional data structures: rowCounts and lastServerInCol. The rowCounts array has a size of n (number of columns), and the lastServerInCol array has a size of m (number of rows). Therefore, the space complexity is O(m+n).

The space used by the input grid is not counted towards the space complexity as it is part of the input.
