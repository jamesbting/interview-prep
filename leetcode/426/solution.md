How to traverse the tree
There are two general strategies to traverse a tree:

Depth First Search (DFS)

In this strategy, we adopt the depth as the priority, so that one would start from a root and reach all the way down to a certain leaf, and then back to the root to reach another branch.

The DFS strategy can further be distinguished as preorder, inorder, and postorder depending on the relative order among the root node, left node, and right node.

Breadth First Search (BFS)

We scan through the tree level by level, following the order of height, from top to bottom. The nodes on higher levels would be visited before the ones with lower levels.

In the following figure, the nodes are numerated in the order you visit them, please follow 1-2-3-4-5 to compare different strategies.

postorder

Here the problem is to implement DFS inorder traversal in a textbook recursion way because of in-place requirement.




Approach 1: Recursion
Algorithm

Standard inorder recursion follows left -> node -> right order, where left and right parts are the recursion calls, and node part is where all processing is done.

Processing here is basically to link the previous node with the current one, and because of that one has to track the last node which is the largest node in a new doubly linked list so far.

postorder

One more detail: one has to keep the first, or the smallest, node as well to close the ring of the doubly linked list.

Here is the algorithm :

Initiate the first and the last nodes as nulls.

Call the standard inorder recursion helper(root) :

If the node is not null :

Call the recursion for the left subtree helper(node.left).

If the last node is not null, link the last and the current node nodes.

Else initiate the first node.

Mark the current node as the last one: last = node.

Call the recursion for the right subtree helper(node.right).

Link the first and the last nodes to close the DLL ring and then return the first node.

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(N) since each node is processed exactly once.

Space complexity : O(N). We have to keep a recursion stack of the size of the tree height, which is O(logN) for the best case of a completely balanced tree and O(N) for the worst case of a completely unbalanced tree.
