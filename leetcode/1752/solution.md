Solution
Overview
We need to find whether the given integer array nums could represent a sorted array that has been rotated some number of times. A sorted array is defined as one arranged in non-decreasing order, meaning each element is less than or equal to the next. A rotation involves shifting a contiguous block of elements to the back of the array, preserving the relative order of all elements.

For example, [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] is a rotated version of the sorted array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. On the other hand, [3, 4, 2, 1, 5] is not a valid rotation of any sorted array because the order of elements is not preserved.

Approach 1: Brute force
Intuition
A simple logical way to approach this problem is to consider all possible rotations of the array. If any rotated array becomes sorted, we can conclude that it is possible; otherwise, it is not.

Suppose the array has n elements. If we rotate the array by 0 positions, it remains the same. If we rotate it by 1 position, the first element moves to the end, and so on. This process continues until we rotate it by n - 1 positions. Rotating the array by exactly n positions brings it back to its original form, so there’s no need to go beyond n - 1.

To implement this, we define a variable rotationOffset that represents the number of positions the array has been rotated. For each rotationOffset, we simulate the rotation by creating a new array, checkSorted. The new array is constructed in two steps: first, we take all elements from the index rotationOffset to the end of the array and append them to checkSorted. Then, we take the remaining elements from the start of the array up to rotationOffset - 1 and append them to checkSorted. This gives us the array as it would appear after rotating by rotationOffset positions. Refer to the illustration below for a clearer understanding of this process:

Once we have the rotated array, the next step is to check if it is sorted in non-decreasing order. If we find a rotation where the array becomes sorted, we immediately return true. If no such rotation exists after trying all possible values of rotationOffset, we return false.

Algorithm
Iterate through all possible rotation offsets (rotationOffset) from 0 to n - 1:

rotationOffset represents the number of positions the array is rotated.
For each rotationOffset, construct a new array checkSorted:

Append elements from index rotationOffset to n - 1 of the original array nums to checkSorted.
Append elements from index 0 to rotationOffset - 1 of nums to checkSorted.
Check if the constructed checkSorted array is sorted:
Iterate through checkSorted from index 0 to n - 2:
If any element is greater than the next element, mark the array as not sorted and break the loop.
If the checkSorted array is sorted, return true.
If no rotation offset results in a sorted array after checking all possible offsets, return false.

Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the size of the nums array.

Time Complexity: O(n 
2
 )

The algorithm iterates through all possible rotation offsets from 0 to n−1. For each offset, it constructs the checkSorted array by iterating through the entire array, which takes O(n). Additionally, it checks if the checkSorted array is sorted, which also takes O(n). As these steps are repeated for n offsets, the total time complexity is O(n⋅n)=O(n 
2
 ).

Space Complexity: O(n)

The algorithm uses an additional array checkSorted to store the elements of the rotated array for each offset. The size of checkSorted is equal to the size of the input array nums, requiring O(n) space. No other significant data structures are used, so the overall space complexity is O(n).

Approach 2: Compare with sorted array
Intuition
In the previous approach, we checked whether each rotation of the array was sorted after computing it. Instead of checking for each rotation, we can create a sorted version of the array and compare each rotation directly with this sorted array.

We iterate through all possible rotationOffset values, similar to the previous approach. For each rotationOffset, we iterate through the elements of nums, starting from rotationOffset and going up to the last index (rotationOffset - 1), cyclically. We compare each element with the corresponding element in the sortedNums array. If all elements match, we return true, as we have found the offset that creates the sortedNums array. Otherwise, we continue checking for the next rotationOffset.

Let's consider an example with the array nums = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]. The sorted version of the array is sortedNums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Now, we check each possible rotation offset:

For rotationOffset = 0, the array is [3, 4, 5, 1, 2], which doesn’t match the sorted array.
For rotationOffset = 1, the array becomes [4, 5, 1, 2, 3], which also doesn’t match.
For rotationOffset = 2, the array is [5, 1, 2, 3, 4], still no match.
For rotationOffset = 3, the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which matches the sorted array.
Since the rotation by 3 produces a sorted array, we return true and stop further checking. If no match had been found after checking all offsets, we would have returned false. This process avoids the need to repeatedly build rotated arrays and directly checks the matching elements for each possible rotation.

Algorithm
Iterate through all possible rotation offsets (rotationOffset) from 0 to n-1:

rotationOffset represents the number of positions the array is rotated.
For each rotationOffset, compare the original array with a sorted version of itself:

Create a sorted copy of the original array sortedNums.
Iterate through the elements of nums starting from rotationOffset and wrapping around cyclically using modulo operation:
Compare each element with the corresponding element in sortedNums.
Check if all elements at each rotationOffset match the sorted array.
If the constructed array matches the sorted array at a specific rotationOffset, return true.
If no rotation offset results in a sorted array after checking all possible offsets, return false.

Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the size of the nums array.

Time Complexity: O(n 
2
 )

The algorithm creates a sorted version of the array, which takes O(nlogn) time. After sorting, it checks all possible rotations by iterating through the array and comparing elements for each rotation, which takes O(n) for each rotation. Hence, the overall time complexity is O(nlogn)+O(n 
2
 )=O(n 
2
 ).

Space Complexity: O(n)

The algorithm uses an additional array sortedNums to store the sorted version of the input array, which requires O(n) space. No other significant data structures are used, so the overall space complexity is O(n).

Approach 3: Find Smallest Element
Intuition
To find whether an array can be sorted by rotation, we need to check if, after a certain point, the sequence of elements remains sorted in a cyclic manner. A more efficient way to do this is by finding the smallest element in the array and using its position to identify the potential rotation offset, which would be the point where the original sorted array begins.

Once we identify the smallest element, we treat it as the "starting" point of the sorted array. From this position, we check if the next n elements, wrapping around cyclically, form a sorted sequence.

The key observation here is that, in a sorted array that has been rotated, all elements should be in non-decreasing order, except for one place where the largest element will be followed by the smallest element due to the rotation. This results in at most one "inversion" — a pair where a number is greater than the next one.

If there are more than one such "inversions," meaning multiple instances where a number is greater than its successor, the array cannot be sorted through any rotation. If there’s at most one inversion, then the array can indeed be sorted by a rotation.

Let's consider an example with the array nums = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]. The smallest element is 1, which we treat as the start of the sorted array. Starting from 1, the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is sorted in a cyclic manner, with only one inversion: 5 is followed by 1, which is expected in a rotated sorted array. Since there is only one inversion, the array can be sorted by rotation, and we return true.

Algorithm
Check if the array is empty or contains only one element. If so, return true, as a single element or an empty array is trivially sorted.

Count the number of inversions (pairs where nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) in the array:

Iterate through the array from 1 to n - 1.
For each element, compare it with the previous element. If the current element is smaller, increment the inversion count.
Compare nums[n - 1] with nums[0]. If nums[0] < nums[n - 1], increment the inversion count.

If the total inversion count is less than or equal to 1, return true. Otherwise, return false.

Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the size of the nums array.

Time Complexity: O(n)

The algorithm counts inversions by iterating through the array once, which takes O(n). Additionally, it checks if there's an inversion between the last and the first element due to rotation, also taking O(1) operations. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity: O(1)

The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, primarily for counting inversions and simple comparisons. No additional data structures are required, so the overall space complexity is O(1).
