Solution
Overview

We need to maximize the value of a given integer by swapping any two digits, but we can do this only once. We aim to figure out the best two digits to swap so that the resulting number is as large as possible.
Approach 1: Brute Force
Intuition

One approach would be to consider all possible swaps by swapping each pair of digits and returning the largest resulting integer.

We convert the number to a string so that individual digits can be easily accessed and manipulated. This allows us to treat the number as an array of characters, making it easier to swap positions without the complexities involved in extracting digits mathematically. Once in string form, we swap every digit with each digit after it to check all possible outcomes. After each swap, we convert the modified string back to an integer and keep track of the largest value we encounter.
Algorithm

    Convert the integer num to a string numStr for easy manipulation of its digits.

    Determine the size of numStr and initialize maxNum to num to track the maximum number found.

    Use a nested loop to try all possible swaps of digits in numStr:

        The outer loop iterates through each digit with index i.

        The inner loop iterates through the subsequent digits with index j (starting from i + 1).

        Inside the inner loop:
            Swap the digits at indices i and j in numStr.
            Convert the modified numStr back to an integer and update maxNum if the new number is larger.
            Swap the digits back to restore the original string for the next iteration.

    After exploring all possible swaps, return maxNum, which contains the largest number achievable through any single swap of digits.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of digits in the input number.

    Time complexity: O(n2)

    The outer loop iterates through each digit (from 0 to n−1), and for each digit, the inner loop also iterates through the remaining digits (from i+1 to n−1). This results in 2n(n−1)​ possible swaps, leading to quadratic time complexity. Each swap involves:
        Performing a swap operation (constant time).
        Converting the modified string back to an integer takes O(n) time due to the length of the string.

    Therefore, the total time complexity combines these two aspects, resulting in O(n2⋅n)=O(n3) for this specific implementation. However, since the main constraint is derived from the nested loops alone, the simplified consideration will generally focus on O(n2).

    Space complexity: O(n)

    The space complexity arises from converting the integer to a string, which requires additional space proportional to the number of digits n in the number. No additional data structures that grow with input size are used, hence the overall space complexity is primarily determined by this string conversion. Thus, it is O(n).

Approach 2: Greedy Two-Pass
Intuition

Approach 1 is inefficient because not all swaps are worth making. Let's consider an approach where we focus only on swaps that will give us the biggest improvement.

Can we identify a pattern in the results that will help us identify the best swap? If we think through some examples, it can be observed that in each example the optimal swap involves moving the largest digit we can move forward to replace a smaller one.

To achieve this, we make two passes over the number. In the first pass, we scan from right to left to identify and store the largest digit we find and its position.

In the second pass, we move from left to right. Now that we know, for each position, the largest digit that appears after it, we check if we can make a swap. The first time we find a digit that is smaller than the largest one that comes after it, we swap them. Since we’re always looking for the largest possible swap, this guarantees that we’ll maximize the number.
Inductive Proof for the Two-Pass Greedy



Algorithm

    Convert the integer num to a string numStr to facilitate digit manipulation.

    Determine the length n of the string representation.

    Initialize an array maxRightIndex of size n to store the index of the largest digit from the current position to the end of the string.

    Populate maxRightIndex in a single backward pass:
        Set maxRightIndex[n - 1] to n - 1, as the last digit is the largest in its own right.
        Iterate from the second last digit to the beginning of the string:
            If the current digit numStr[i] is greater than the digit at the index stored in maxRightIndex[i + 1], update maxRightIndex[i] to i.
            Otherwise, keep maxRightIndex[i] as maxRightIndex[i + 1].

    In a second pass, check for the first opportunity to swap for maximum value:
        Iterate through each digit in numStr:
            If the current digit numStr[i] is less than the digit at the index maxRightIndex[i], a beneficial swap can be made.
                Swap numStr[i] with numStr[maxRightIndex[i]] to maximize the number.
                Convert the modified string back to an integer and return it immediately.

    If no beneficial swap is found throughout the iterations, return the original number num.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of digits in the input number.

    Time complexity: O(n)

    Converting the integer num to its string representation takes O(n).

    We iterate through the digits from right to left, making one comparison per digit. This pass takes O(n) time.

    We iterate from left to right, checking whether the current digit is smaller than the maximum digit to its right. This also takes O(n) time.

    Converting the modified string back to an integer takes O(n) time.

    Overall, each operation in the algorithm takes linear time, so the total time complexity is O(n).

    Space complexity: O(n)

    We store the string representation of the number, which requires O(n) space.

    We maintain an array maxRightIndex of size n, which also takes O(n) space.

    The space used by simple variables like num and loop counters is constant, i.e., O(1).

    Thus, the total space complexity is O(n).

Approach 3: Suboptimal Greedy
Intuition

A natural follow-up question is: can we simplify this even more? Let's see if we can reduce our approach by using a pass to record the last occurrence of each digit in the given integer, and then use that information to find an optimal swap (if one exists).

Let's walk through what this would look like using Example 1 from the problem description:

We'll do one scan from left to right, noting the positions of the digits in the number (2, 7, 3, and 6):

    Last occurrence of 2: index 0
    Last occurrence of 7: index 1
    Last occurrence of 3: index 2
    Last occurrence of 6: index 3

Next, we'll use the stored values to check if there are any small values with larger values that follow:

    We start with '2' and check if any larger digits appear later in the number. In the case of 2736, we compare '2' with '7', '3', and '6'.
    Since '7' is the largest digit that appears after '2', we choose '7' as the best swap.

Inductive Proof for Suboptimal Greedy




Algorithm

    Convert the input integer num to a string numStr to facilitate digit manipulation.

    Get the length n of numStr.

    Initialize an array lastSeen of size 10, filled with -1, to store the last occurrence index of each digit (0-9).

    Record the last occurrence of each digit:
        For each index i in numStr, update lastSeen[numStr[i] - '0'] to i, which stores the last position of each digit.

    Traverse the digits in numStr to find the first digit that can be swapped with a larger one:
        For each index i, iterate d from 9 down to numStr[i] - '0':
            If lastSeen[d] > i, it means there exists a larger digit d that can be swapped with numStr[i].
                Perform the swap between numStr[i] and numStr[lastSeen[d]].
                Immediately return the integer value of the modified string using stoi(numStr).

    If no swap has been performed throughout the iteration, return the original number num since it is already maximized.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of digits in the input number.

    Time complexity: O(n)

    Converting the integer num to its string representation takes O(n).

    We loop through the string numStr to fill the lastSeen array, which takes O(n) time.

    The outer loop runs n times (once for each digit), and for each digit, the inner loop runs at most 9 times (since there are at most 9 different digits larger than the current one to check). Thus, the traversal and comparison step takes O(9n)=O(n) time.

    Converting the modified string back to an integer takes O(n) time.

    Overall, all steps are bounded by O(n), so the total time complexity is O(n).

    Space complexity: O(n)

    The string numStr requires O(n) space to store the digits of the integer num.

    The array lastSeen is of fixed size 10 (for digits 0 through 9), so it takes O(1) space.

    No other significant additional space is used.

    Thus, the overall space complexity is dominated by the space needed to store the string, which is O(n).

Approach 4: Space Optimized Greedy
Intuition

As we move through the number, we don’t need to know the position of every digit—we only need to know the position of the largest digit we’ve seen so far.

We start by scanning the number from right to left. As we move, we keep track of the largest digit we’ve encountered. Whenever we come across a smaller digit, we consider it a candidate for swapping with the largest one we’ve seen.

So we compare each digit with the maximum digit to its right. If it’s smaller, we mark it for swapping. By the time we finish scanning the number, we’ll know the best swap to make. If we find a smaller digit and a larger one to swap it with, we perform the swap. Otherwise, we leave the number unchanged.

This way we can save space by not needing to track all positions, and it works because, as we move from right to left, we are always aware of the largest possible swap we could make.

The algorithm is visualized below:

Current
Algorithm

    Convert the integer num to a string numStr for easier manipulation of individual digits.

    Initialize variables:
        n to store the length of numStr.
        maxDigitIndex to track the index of the maximum digit encountered (initialized to -1).
        swapIdx1 and swapIdx2 to track the indices of the digits to be swapped (both initialized to -1).

    Traverse the string numStr from right to left:
        If maxDigitIndex is -1 or the current digit numStr[i] is greater than the digit at maxDigitIndex, update maxDigitIndex to i (indicating a new maximum digit has been found).
        If numStr[i] is less than the digit at maxDigitIndex, mark swapIdx1 as i (the smaller digit to be swapped) and swapIdx2 as maxDigitIndex (the larger digit to swap with).

    After completing the traversal, check if a valid swap has been identified:
        If both swapIdx1 and swapIdx2 are not -1, perform the swap between numStr[swapIdx1] and numStr[swapIdx2].

    Convert the modified string back to an integer and return it. If no swap occurred, return the original number.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of digits in the input number.

    Time complexity: O(n)

    Converting the integer num to its string representation takes O(n).

    The loop iterates over the string once from right to left, performing constant-time operations for each character, making the loop cost O(n).

    Swap runs in constant time O(1).

    Converting the modified string back to an integer takes O(n) time.

    Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the traversal and conversions, giving us O(n).

    Space complexity: O(n)

    The numStr variable is a string representation of the input number, which requires O(n) space to store.

    The other variables (maxDigitIndex, swapIdx1, swapIdx2) require O(1) space since they are just integer indices.

    Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n), mainly due to the string representation of the number.
