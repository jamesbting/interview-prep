Solution
Overview

Define the pivot index as representing the smallest element in nums.

In a rotated sorted array, the pivot value signifies where the rotation occurs. It partitions the array (of length n) into two sorted portions nums[0 ~ pivot - 1] and nums[pivot ~ n - 1].
Approach 1: Find Pivot Index + Binary Search
Intuition

    If you are not familiar with binary search, please refer to our explore cards Binary Search Explore Card. We will focus on the usage in this article and not the underlying principles or implementation details.

To pinpoint the pivot value, we can employ a modified binary search algorithm and find the leftmost element that is smaller than or equal to the last element in nums.

After identifying the middle element in the searching space [left ~ right], we compare nums[mid] with nums[-1].

    If nums[mid] > nums[-1], it suggests that the pivot value lies on the right of nums[mid]. We will then proceed with the right half of the search space, which is [mid + 1 ~ right].
    Otherwise, the pivot value is nums[mid] or it's situated to the left of nums[mid], we continue with the left half of the searching space, which is [left ~ mid - 1].

By determining the pivot value, we set the boundaries for our subsequent binary searches. Once we have the pivot value, we can execute two binary searches on each half of the array to locate the target element.

        Note: the typical way to calculate mid is (left + right) / 2. However, a safer way is left + (right - left) / 2. The two equations are equivalent, but the second one is safer because it guarantees no number larger than right is ever stored. In the first equation, if left + right is huge, then it could end up overflowing.

Algorithm

    Perform a binary search to locate the pivot element by initializing the boundaries of the searching space as left = 0 and right = n - 1. While left < right:
        Let mid = left + (right - left) // 2.
        If nums[mid] > nums[n - 1], this suggests that pivot is located to the right of mid, hence we set left = mid + 1. Otherwise, pivot could be either at mid or to the left of mid, in which case we should set right = mid - 1.

    Upon completion of the binary search, we have the pivot index denoted as pivot = left.

    nums consists of two sorted subarrays, nums[0 ~ left - 1] and nums[left ~ n - 1].

    Perform a binary search over nums[0 ~ left - 1] for target. If target is within this subarray, return its index.

    Otherwise, perform a binary search over nums[left ~ n - 1] for target. If target is within this subarray, return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of nums.

    Time complexity: O(logn)
        The algorithm requires one binary search to locate pivot, and at most 2 binary searches to find target. Each binary search takes O(logn) time.

    Space complexity: O(1)
        We only need to update several parameters left, right and mid, which takes O(1) space.


Approach 2: Find Pivot Index + Binary Search with Shift
Intuition

The array we're working with has been rotated by a certain number of steps, which means we can't apply a regular binary search to the modified array. However, if we can revert this array to its original sorted form, then a conventional binary search becomes a viable approach.

Our key task is to locate pivot, the index of the smallest value in nums. Notably, nums[pivot] would have been at index 0 in the unrotated, original array. Hence, if we were to rotate it to the right by n - pivot steps (taking the modulus of n into account), it would return to its original position, index 0.

Applying the same transformation to every element enables us to revert the rotated array back to its original, sorted form.

At this point, we can perform a conventional binary search to locate the target. Let's assume that nums[i] = target. Remembering that we had to shift every element to the right by n - pivot steps to reach the sorted version of nums, we now need to shift the index in the sorted nums to the left by n - pivot steps to find its corresponding index, i, in the original nums. This gives us i - (n - pivot) (taking the modulus of n into account).

img

Crucially, there's no need to actually create the sorted version of nums from the original nums. We can simply represent the sorted nums by shifting the indices.

Algorithm

    Perform a binary search to locate the pivot element by initializing the boundaries of the searching space as left = 0 and right = n - 1. While left < right:
        Let mid = left + (right - left) // 2.
        If nums[mid] > nums[n - 1], this suggests that pivot is located to the right of mid, hence we set left = mid + 1. Otherwise, pivot could be either at mid or to the left of mid, in which case we should set right = mid - 1.

    Upon completion of the binary search, we have the pivot index denoted as pivot = left.

    Set the boundaries of the search space as (pivot + shift) % n and (pivot - 1 + shift) % n.

    While left < right, we get the middle index mid = (left + right) // 2, and compare nums[(mid - shift + n) % n] with target.
        If nums[(mid - shift + n) % n] is equal to target, return mid - shift + n
        If nums[(mid - shift + n) % n] > target, continue with the left half by setting right as mid - 1.
        If nums[(mid - shift + n) % n] < target, continue with the right half by setting left as mid + 1.

    Return -1 once the binary search is complete.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of nums.

    Time complexity: O(logn)
        The algorithm requires one binary search to locate pivot and one binary search over the shifted indices to find target. Each binary search takes O(logn) time.

    Space complexity: O(1)
        We only need to update several parameters left, right mid and shift, which takes O(1) space.


Approach 3: One Binary Search
Intuition

The two preceding approaches both comprise two steps:

    Perform a binary search to identify the pivot index.
    Conduct another binary search to locate the target value.

However, we can perform these two steps within a single binary search.

Let's take a step back and consider a regular binary search. Why are we able to confidently discard half of the array after comparing target with the middle value nums[mid]? The reason is that both halves of the array are sorted. Hence, if target is less than the middle value, it's assured to be smaller than every value in the right half. If target is larger than the middle value, it's guaranteed to be larger than every value in the left half. Therefore, we can safely discard one half of nums in either case.

However, a rotated sorted array may not possess this characteristic – we can't determine whether target is definitively not in the array just by comparing boundary values.

If we cut a subarray nums[left ~ right] by the index mid. We split this subarray into 3 parts:

    subarray nums[left ~ mid - 1]
    element nums[mid].
    subarray nums[mid + 1, right].

It is important to note that there is at most one rotated sorted array in the two subarrays, which means that there is at least one sorted array for comparison.

img

Therefore, we can compare target with the sorted half to decide which subarray to retain for the next round.

    It is straightforward to determine if a sorted array A[l ~ r] could possibly contain target, we can simply compare target with two boundary values A[l] and A[r].

        If A[l] <= target <= A[r], then A[l ~ r] might contain target, which needs to be verified by binary search, we will continue with this subarray.

        Otherwise, target is guaranteed to not be in A[l ~ r], and there is no need to search over this array, we will continue with the other subarray.


To sum up, there are 3 possible cases after comparing target with nums[mid]:

Case 1. If nums[mid] = target, which denotes that we have found target, return mid as its index.

Case 2. If nums[mid] >= nums[left]. It implies that the left subarray nums[left ~ mid] is sorted. We can determine whether to proceed with this subarray by comparing target with the boundary elements:

    If nums[left] <= target and target < nums[mid], it suggests that the sorted left half might include target while the other half does not contain target. Consequently, we focus on the left half for further steps.
    Otherwise, the left half is guaranteed not to contain target, and we will move on to the right half.

img

Case 3. If nums[mid] < nums[left], it implies that the left subarray is rotated and the right subarray nums[mid ~ right] is sorted. Therefore, we can determine whether to proceed with the right subarray by comparing the target with its boundary elements:

    If nums[mid] < target and target < nums[right], it implies that the sorted right half might contain target. As a result, we will move on with the right half.
    Otherwise, the right half is guaranteed not to contain target, and we will move on to the left half.

Algorithm

    Initialize pointers:
        Set left to 0.
        Set right to n - 1 where n is the length of the array nums.

    Perform binary search:
        While left is less than or equal to right:

            Calculate the middle index mid as left + (right - left) / 2.

            Case 1: Check if the middle element nums[mid] is equal to target.
                If true, return mid as the index of target.

            Case 2: Check if the subarray from left to mid is sorted (nums[mid] >= nums[left]).
                If target is within the range [nums[left], nums[mid]):
                    Adjust the search range by setting right to mid - 1.
                Otherwise:
                    Adjust the search range by setting left to mid + 1.

            Case 3: If the subarray from mid to right is sorted (nums[mid] > nums[right]):
                If target is within the range (nums[mid], nums[right]]:
                    Adjust the search range by setting left to mid + 1.
                Otherwise:
                    Adjust the search range by setting right to mid - 1.

    If the target is not found, return -1.
