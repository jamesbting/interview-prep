Solution
Overview

We are given an integer array derived of length n. This array is formed by taking a binary array original (an array containing only 0s and 1s) and computing the bitwise XOR between adjacent elements in it.

For the last element in derived, the XOR is calculated as:
derived[n−1]=original[n−1]XORoriginal[0]

Our task is to determine if there exists a binary array original that could have generated the derived array.

To understand how to approach the problem, let’s recall some fundamental properties of XOR:

    Commutativity: aXORb=bXORa
    The order in which you XOR two numbers doesn’t matter.

    Associativity: (aXORb)XORc=aXOR(bXORc)
    Grouping of XOR operations doesn’t affect the result.

    Identity: aXOR0=a
    XOR with 0 leaves the number unchanged.

    Self-inverse: aXORa=0
    XORing a number with itself results in 0.

    Inversion:
    If aXORb=c, then:
        a=bXORc
        b=aXORc

These properties will help us manipulate XOR equations in coming sections to solve the problem.
Approach 1: Simulation
Intuition

To determine whether a valid original array can be constructed from the given derived array, we can carefully simulate how the original array would be built.

From the problem, we know:
derived[i]=original[i]XORoriginal[i+1]

Using the inversion property of XOR, we can rewrite this as:
original[i+1]=derived[i]XORoriginal[i]

This means that if we know the value of the original[i], we can calculate the next element, original[i+1], using the corresponding value from derived.

The first element of original, original[0], can be either 0 or 1 (since it’s binary).

    If we assume original[0] = 0, we can calculate the rest of the array.
    Similarly, we can repeat the process assuming original[0] = 1.

Once we compute all the elements of the original for both starting points, we need to check if they satisfy the circular condition:
derived[n−1]=original[n−1]XORoriginal[0]

This ensures that the last element in derived matches the XOR of the first and last elements of original.

If the circular condition is satisfied for either of the two cases (original[0] = 0 or original[0] = 1), then a valid original array exists, and we return true. Otherwise, we return false.
Algorithm

    Create an array original initialized with {0}.

    Construct the original array assuming the first element is 0:
        Iterate through the derived array using a loop:
            For each index i, calculate the next element in original as (derived[i] ^ original[i]) and append it to original.

    Check if the first and last elements of original are equal and store the result in checkForZero.

    Create an array original initialized with {1}.

    Construct the original array assuming the first element is 1:
        Iterate through the derived array using a loop:
            For each index i, calculate the next element in original as (derived[i] ^ original[i]) and append it to original.

    Check if the first and last elements of original are equal and store the result in checkForOne.

    Return the logical OR of checkForZero and checkForOne.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let n be the size of the derived array.

    Time Complexity: O(n)

    The algorithm constructs the original array twice, once starting with original[0] = 0 and once with original[0] = 1. Each construction involves iterating through the derived array once, which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(2⋅n)=O(n).

    Space Complexity: O(n)

    The algorithm uses an additional array original to store the intermediate results during its construction. The size of the original array is equal to the size of the derived array, requiring O(n) space. No other significant data structures are used, so the overall space complexity is O(n).

Approach 2: Cumulative XOR
Intuition

Observe the following equations that represent the relationship between the elements of the derived and original arrays:

derived[0] = original[0] XOR original[1]
derived[1] = original[1] XOR original[2]
derived[2] = original[2] XOR original[3]
derived[3] = original[3] XOR original[4]

...

derived[n-1] = original[n-1] XOR original[0]

Each element in original appears exactly twice in the equations: once as original[i] and once as original[i+1]. For example:

    original[0] appears in derived[0] (original[0] XOR original[1])
    original[0] also appears in derived[n-1] (original[n-1] XOR original[0])

Since XOR is both commutative and associative, the order doesn’t matter. When all occurrences of original[i] are XORed together, they cancel each other out: original[0] XOR original[0] XOR original[1] XOR original[1] ... = 0

If the derived array is valid (i.e., it was generated from some original), then the XOR of all elements in derived must be 0. This is because all elements of original cancel out when XORed.
Algorithm

    Initialize a variable XOR to 0. This will store the cumulative XOR of elements in the derived array.

    Iterate through each element in the derived array:
        For each element, compute the XOR with the current value of XOR and update XOR.

    After the loop, check the value of XOR:
        If XOR == 0, return true (indicating the array is valid).
        Otherwise, return false.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let n be the size of the derived array.

    Time Complexity: O(n)

    The algorithm iterates through all elements of the derived array once to compute the cumulative XOR. Each XOR operation takes constant time, and the loop runs for n iterations. Thus, the time complexity is O(n).

    Space Complexity: O(1)

    The algorithm uses a single integer variable XOR to store the cumulative XOR of elements in the array. No additional data structures are used, so the space complexity is O(1).

Approach 3: Sum Parity
Intuition

Similar to the previous approach, we can rely on the properties of XOR. However, this time, we focus on the parity (even or odd nature) of the numbers involved.

The XOR of two binary numbers produces a result based on their bits. Specifically:

0 XOR 0 = 0
1 XOR 1 = 0
0 XOR 1 = 1
1 XOR 0 = 1

Notice that when two identical numbers are XORed, the result is 0.

For an XOR operation to result in a balanced and valid sequence, the total number of 1s in the derived array (which represents mismatched bits) must be even. This is because each 1 in derived corresponds to a mismatch between adjacent elements in the original array, and mismatches can only be resolved in pairs.

The sum of the elements in derived gives the total count of 1s in the array.

    If the sum is even, it means that the mismatches can be paired and resolved, allowing us to construct a valid original array.
    If the sum is odd, it’s impossible to resolve the mismatches, and no valid original array can exist.

Algorithm

    Initialize a variable sum to 0. This will store the cumulative sum of elements in the derived array.

    Iterate through each element in the derived array:
        For each element, add it's value to sum.

    After the loop, check the value of sum:
        If sum % 2 == 0, return true (indicating the array is valid).
        Otherwise, return false.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let n be the size of the derived array.

    Time Complexity: O(n)

    The algorithm iterates through all elements of the derived array once to compute the cumulative sum and find it's parity. Thus, the time complexity is O(n).

    Space Complexity: O(1)

    No additional data structures are used, so the space complexity is O(1).
