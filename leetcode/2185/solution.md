Approach 1: Brute Force
Intuition
Given the small constraints of the problem where words.length ≤ 100 (the array contains at most 100 words) and words[i].length, pref.length ≤ 100 (each word and the prefix can be up to 100 characters long), a brute-force approach is viable. This approach involves checking each word in the words list to see if it starts with pref. We can do this using two pointers, one for the current word and one for pref, both starting at index 0.

To implement this logic, we iterate through the list of words and for each word, compare its characters with the corresponding characters in pref up to the length of pref. If at any point the characters don't match or if the word's length is smaller than the length of pref, we stop checking that word and move to the next one.

The counter is incremented only when the prefix matches entirely. Finally, after examining all the words in the list, the counter holds the number of words that have pref as their prefix, which is returned as the result.

Algorithm
For the main method prefixCount:

Initialize a variable count to 0 to track the number of strings with the given prefix.
Iterate through each string in the input array words. For each string:
Add the result of hasPrefix to count.
Return the final count.
For the helper method hasPrefix:

Initialize a variable itr to track the current character position being compared.
Start a loop that continues while itr is less than both the length of str and pref:
Compare characters at position itr in both strings.
If characters don't match, return 0 immediately as the prefix is not found.
After the loop ends, check if itr equals the length of pref.
If not equal, return 0 as the string was too short to contain the prefix.
Return 1 indicating the prefix was found.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the length of the input array words and m be the length of the prefix string pref.

Time complexity: O(n⋅m)

The outer loop in prefixCount iterates through each string in the array words, which takes O(n) operations.

For each string, we call hasPrefix which compares characters until it reaches the end of the prefix or finds a mismatch. In the worst case, this character comparison takes O(m) operations.

Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n⋅m).

Space complexity: O(1)

The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. We only store the counter variables count and itr. No additional data structures are created that grow with the input size. Thus, the space complexity is constant, O(1).

Approach 2: Built-In Methods
Intuition
Matching prefixes is an extremely common task in programming. Because of this, most popular programming languages provide built-in methods to handle prefix matching. These built-in methods have been thoroughly tested and optimized over time, making them more reliable and efficient than custom-written code.

For this reason, it's generally better to use these built-in methods rather than writing our own implementation. Let's look at some popular built-in methods that we can use for this problem:

Java
String.startsWith(String prefix)
Checks if the string begins with the specified prefix.

Stream.filter(Predicate<T> predicate)
Filters elements in a stream based on a given condition (e.g., checking if a string starts with a prefix).

String.substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)
Extracts a substring from a string, which can be compared manually to check for a prefix.

C++
std::string::find (or std::string::rfind)
Finds the position of the first or last occurrence of a substring and is commonly used to check if it occurs at the start.

std::string::substr(size_t pos, size_t len)
Extracts a substring starting at a position, which can be used to compare the prefix manually.

std::mismatch (from <algorithm>)
Compares elements of two ranges (e.g., a prefix and the beginning of a string) and determines if they match.

Python3
str.startswith(prefix)
Directly checks if the string starts with the specified prefix.

filter(function, iterable)
Applies a function (e.g., a lambda checking startswith) to an iterable and filters elements that match.

any() and all() (combined with slicing)
Can be used to validate whether a prefix condition holds across a collection.

Algorithm
Initialize a variable count to 0 to track the number of strings with the given prefix.
Iterate through each string word in the input array words:
Check if word starts with the given prefix using the built-in string method startsWith.
If so, increment the count by 1.
After examining all strings, return the final count.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the length of the input array words and m be the length of the prefix string pref.

Time complexity: O(n⋅m)

The outer loop iterates through each string in the array words, which takes O(n) operations. For each string, the startsWith method needs to compare characters until it reaches the end of the prefix or finds a mismatch. In the worst case, this comparison takes O(m) operations.

Thus, the total time complexity is O(n⋅m).

Space complexity: O(1)

The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. We only store the counter variable count. No additional data structures are created that grow with the input size.

Therefore, the space complexity is constant, O(1).

Approach 3: Trie
Intuition
The process of matching characters sequentially from the beginning aligns perfectly with the concept of a Trie. A Trie is a specialized tree-like data structure designed to handle strings efficiently, especially for operations like prefix searches, word insertions, and word lookups.

Each node in a Trie represents a single character, and the path from the root node to any other node forms a prefix or a word.

Usually a Trie is used in two below ways:

Insertion: When inserting a word into the Trie, we start at the root and traverse down the tree, creating new nodes for each character of the word if they don't already exist. At the end of the word, we mark the final node to signify the completion of the word.

Search for a Prefix: To check if a word starts with a given prefix, we simply traverse the Trie following the nodes corresponding to each character of the prefix. If we can traverse all characters successfully, the prefix exists in the Trie.

For example, if we built a Trie using the words array in Example 1 of the problem description, this is how it would look like:



What makes Tries particularly powerful is their ability to efficiently handle prefix-based operations. Think about how you use autocomplete on your phone - as you type each character, it quickly suggests words that start with those letters. Tries are thus a natural choice for problems involving prefixes or auto-completion. By structuring the characters hierarchically, they allow for fast and intuitive access to any subset of stored strings.

Our version of the Trie has a unique feature - instead of just marking where words end, we keep count of how many words share each prefix. For example, if three words begin with "cat", then after we reach 't' in the Trie, that node would show a count of 3.

To build this solution, we start by designing our Trie structure. Each node needs two essential pieces: links to its children (representing the next possible characters) and the count variable. Since we're working with lowercase English letters, we can use an array of size 26 for the links, where each index represents a character (a = 0, b = 1, etc.). This array approach gives us constant-time access to child nodes.

When adding words to our Trie, we follow a path determined by each character in the word. If we're adding "cat", we start at the root and follow (or create) links for 'c', then 'a', then 't'. The crucial part is incrementing the count at each node we visit. This means that after adding "cat", "car", and "carpet", the node for 'r' would have a count of 2 (for "car" and "carpet"), while the node for 't' would have a count of 1.

The counting process becomes straightforward once our Trie is built. To find how many words start with a prefix, we simply navigate the Trie following the characters of our prefix. If we can follow the entire prefix, the count at the final node gives us our answer. However, if we can't follow the complete prefix (a link is missing), we know no words start with that prefix, so we return 0.

Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the total number of strings in the input array words, l be the maximum length of any string in words, and m be the length of the prefix string pref.

Time complexity: O(n⋅l+m)

The algorithm has two main phases. In the first phase, we build the Trie by inserting all words. For each word of maximum length l, we perform l operations to add each character. Since we have n words, building the Trie takes O(n⋅l) time.

In the second phase, searching for the prefix takes O(m) operations.

Thus, the total time complexity is O(n⋅l+m).

Space complexity: O(n⋅l)

The space complexity is determined by the size of the Trie structure. In the worst case, when there are no common prefixes among the words, each character of each word will require a new node. Each node contains a fixed-size array of 26 pointers and a count variable. With n words of maximum length l, the Trie can contain up to O(n⋅l) nodes. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n⋅l).
