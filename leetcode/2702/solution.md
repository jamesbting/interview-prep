Intuition
The problem involves adjusting numbers using specific operations defined by parameters x and y, where the operations could be reducing numbers by y and selectively increasing some numbers by x−y since x>y. The objective is to make all numbers non-positive with the minimum operations.

Approach
Transform the Problem: Initially, decrease all numbers by y. For numbers that are still positive, increment them by x−y.
Binary Search: Implement a binary search to find the minimum n, where reducing all numbers by n×y and increasing some by x−y makes all numbers non-positive.
Validity Function (isValid): For a given n, determine if it's feasible to adjust the numbers to non-positive by reducing each by n×y and increasing some by x−y.
Complexity
Time Complexity: O(nlogM), where n is the number of elements in the array, and M is the maximum number in the array divided by y. This accounts for the binary search operation and the iteration through the array in the validity check.

Space Complexity: O(1), which is constant space, as the space requirement does not scale with the size of the input array.

Code Review
Here's the provided code snippet with enhanced clarity and comments for a better understanding:

from typing import List
from math import ceil

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], x: int, y: int) -> int:
        # Objective: decrement all numbers by y, then selectively increment some by x - y
        def isValid(n: int) -> bool:
            count = 0
            for num in nums:
                if num - n * y > 0:
                    count += ceil((num - n * y) / (x - y))  # Count increments needed for numbers > 0
            return count <= n  # Check if the number of increments is feasible with n operations

        left = 1
        right = max(nums) // y + 1
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if not isValid(mid):
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        return left
