Solution
Overview

We are given two arrays, nums1 and nums2, consisting of non-negative integers. From these arrays, we can imagine forming another array, nums3, where each element is the result of XORing an element from nums1 with an element from nums2.

For example, if nums1 = [a1, a2] and nums2 = [b1, b2], then:

nums3 = [a1 ^ b1, a1 ^ b2, a2 ^ b1, a2 ^ b2]

Our task is to calculate the XOR of all elements in nums3. This can be expressed as:

result = (a1 ^ b1) ^ (a1 ^ b2) ^ (a2 ^ b1) ^ (a2 ^ b2)

Approach 1: Hash Map
Intuition

Suppose we are working with two arrays, nums1 and nums2. When we compute the XOR between every element of nums1 and every element of nums2, the result can be written as:

(a1 ^ b1) ^ (a1 ^ b2) ^ (a2 ^ b1) ^ (a2 ^ b2)

Because XOR is commutative (the order of operations doesnâ€™t matter), we can rearrange this to group elements together:

result = (a1 ^ a1 ^ ... repeated n2 times) ^ (a2 ^ a2 ^ ... repeated n2 times) ^ 
         (b1 ^ b1 ^ ... repeated n1 times) ^ (b2 ^ b2 ^ ... repeated n1 times)

Here:

    Each element of nums1 appears n2 times in the calculation (where n2 is the size of nums2).
    Each element of nums2 appears n1 times in the calculation (where n1 is the size of nums1).

To simplify the computation, letâ€™s recall two critical properties of XOR:

    XOR with itself results in 0: a ^ a = 0
    XOR with 0 results in the same number: a ^ 0 = a

Using these properties, we can see that if an element is XOR'd with itself an even number of times, the result is 0. For example:
a ^ a ^ a ^ a = (a ^ a) ^ (a ^ a) = 0 ^ 0 = 0

However, if an element is XOR'd an odd number of times, the result is the element itself, since all pairs cancel out, leaving only one instance of the element. For example:
a ^ a ^ a = (a ^ a) ^ a = 0 ^ a = a

Based on these observations, the task now reduces to counting how many times each element appears in the XOR computation.

    Elements appearing an even number of times contribute 0 to the final result.
    Elements appearing an odd number of times retain their value in the final result.

One of the best data structures to count the frequency of an element is a hash map. We iterate through the elements of nums1 and nums2 and add their total occurrences to the map. Once the frequencies are determined, we initialize a variable ans to store the XOR result. For each key in the map, we XOR it with ans if its total occurrence is odd. The final value of ans is returned as our required answer.

Algorithm

    Initialize two variables len1 and len2 to store the lengths of the input arrays nums1 and nums2 respectively.
    Initialize a hashmap freq to store the frequency of each number's appearances in the final XOR computations.
    Iterate through each number in the first array nums1:
        For each number, add it to the frequency map with a count equal to len2.
    Iterate through each number in the second array nums2:
        For each number, add it to the frequency map with a count equal to len1.
    Initialize a variable ans to store the final result, starting with 0.
    Iterate through the frequency map's keys:
        For each number, check if its frequency is odd.
            If odd, XOR the number with the current value of ans.
    Return the final computed XOR value stored in ans.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let n and m be the lengths of the arrays nums1 and nums2 respectively.

    Time complexity: O(n+m)

    The algorithm first iterates through nums1 which takes O(n) time. Then it iterates through nums2 which takes O(m) time. Finally, it iterates through the frequency map which can contain at most (n+m) unique numbers. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n+m).

    Space complexity: O(n+m)

    The algorithm uses a hash map to store frequencies of numbers. In the worst case, if all numbers in both arrays are unique, the hash map will store (n+m) key-value pairs. No other additional space is used that grows with input size. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n+m).

Approach 2: Space Optimized Bit Manipulation
Intuition

A key observation from the previous approach is that the contribution of any element from nums1 or nums2 to the final result depends on the length of the other array:

    For an element a1 in nums1, it is XOR'd with every element in nums2. So, its total contribution depends on the length of nums2 (n2).
    Similarly, for an element b1 in nums2, its total contribution depends on the length of nums1 (n1).

Letâ€™s simplify this further:

    If n2 (length of nums2) is even, each element in nums1 is XOR'd an even number of times. Using the property of XOR (a ^ a = 0), all such elements cancel out and contribute 0 to the result.
    If n2 is odd, each element in nums1 is XOR'd an odd number of times. Using the property that an odd number of XORs leaves the element unchanged, all elements in nums1 retain their value in the result.

The same logic applies to nums2 when considering the length of nums1.

Depending on whether n1 and n2 are even or odd, there are four possible scenarios:

    Both n1 and n2 are even:

    All elements in nums1 and nums2 contribute 0 to the result since their total occurrences are even.

    n2 is odd, n1 is even:

    Elements in nums1 occur an odd number of times and contribute to the result.
    Elements in nums2 occur an even number of times and contribute 0.
    Thus the answer will be XOR of all elements in nums1.

    n1 is odd, n2 is even:

    Elements in nums2 occur an odd number of times and contribute to the result.
    Elements in nums1 occur an even number of times and contribute 0.
    Thus the answer will be XOR of all elements in nums2.

    Both n1 and n2 are odd:

    Elements in both nums1 and nums2 occur an odd number of times and retain their value in the result.
    Thus the answer will be XOR of all elements in nums1 XOR'd with XOR of all elements in nums2.

Algorithm

    Initialize two variables xor1 and xor2 to store the XOR results for the first and second arrays respectively, both starting at 0.
    Initialize two variables len1 and len2 to store the lengths of the input arrays nums1 and nums2 respectively.
    If the length of the second array nums2 is odd:
        Iterate through each number in the first array nums1. For each number:
            Compute its XOR with the current value of xor1.
    If the length of the first array nums1 is odd:
        Iterate through each number in the second array nums2. For each number:
            Compute its XOR with the current value of xor2.
    Compute and return the XOR of xor1 and xor2 as the final result.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let n and m be the lengths of the arrays nums1 and nums2 respectively.

    Time complexity: O(n+m)

    The algorithm performs two conditional iterations. If len2 is odd, it iterates through nums1 taking O(n) time. If len1 is odd, it iterates through nums2 taking O(m) time. In the worst case, both conditions are true, leading to a total time complexity of O(n+m).

    Space complexity: O(1)

    The algorithm only uses four variables (xor1, xor2, len1, len2) regardless of the input size. These variables consume constant space and do not grow with the input size. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
