Solution
Overview

We are given two arrays, A and B, each containing a shuffled list of numbers from 1 to n. Our task is to construct a new array C, where each element C[i] represents the count of numbers from 1 to i + 1 that are present in both A and B up to that index.

For example, consider A = [1, 3, 2, 4] and B = [3, 1, 2, 4]:

    At i = 0 (first element): No numbers are common between A and B yet, so C[0] = 0.
    At i = 1: The numbers 1 and 3 are common in both arrays, so C[1] = 2.
    At i = 2: The numbers 1, 2, and 3 are common, so C[2] = 3.
    At i = 3: All four numbers, 1, 2, 3, and 4, are common in both arrays, so C[3] = 4.

Thus, the resulting array is C = [0, 2, 3, 4].
Approach 1: Brute Force
Intuition

A straightforward and logical approach to finding the prefix common array is to use a brute-force method. The core idea is iterating through each index currentIndex of the input arrays A and B and calculating the number of common elements up to that index.

For each element in the subarray of A, we compare it with each element in the subarray of B. If we find a match, we count it as a common element. Since the elements in both arrays are unique, we don't need to worry about counting duplicates. Once we find a match for an element, we can stop further checks for that element, knowing it has already been accounted for.

This process is repeated for every index in the arrays, and the results are stored in an array, which we will refer to as prefixCommonArray (replacing C for clarity) to better reflect its purpose as the final output array.
Algorithm

    Initialize n to the size of array A and create an array prefixCommonArray of size n to store the common count for each prefix.

    Iterate through each index currentIndex from 0 to n-1:

        Initialize commonCount to 0, which will store the number of common elements in the current prefix.

        For each aIndex from 0 to currentIndex:
            For each bIndex from 0 to currentIndex:
                If A[aIndex] equals B[bIndex], increment commonCount and break the inner loop.

        Store commonCount in prefixCommonArray[currentIndex] to record the number of common elements for the current prefix.

    Return prefixCommonArray, which contains the common count for each prefix of A and B.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let n be the size of the input arrays A and B.

    Time complexity: O(n3)

    The outer loop runs n times (from currentIndex = 0 to currentIndex = n-1). For each iteration of the outer loop, the first inner loop runs currentIndex + 1 times, and the second inner loop also runs currentIndex + 1 times.

    Therefore, the total number of iterations is: ∑currentIndex=0n−1​(currentIndex+1)×(currentIndex+1)=∑currentIndex=0n−1​(currentIndex+1)2

    This simplifies to: ∑k=1n​k2=6n(n+1)(2n+1)​

    Asymptotically, this is O(n3).

    Space complexity: O(1)

    The space complexity is constant because no additional data structures are used apart from the output container (prefixCommonArray), which is excluded from the analysis as it’s a requirement from the problem statement. Only a few variables like currentIndex, commonCount, aIndex, and bIndex are used, which take O(1) space.

Approach 2: Hash Set
Intuition

We can improve the brute-force method by using an unordered set to track the elements encountered so far in both arrays A and B. This is significantly more efficient than the brute-force method, where we had to check every element in both arrays for each index. The key idea is to reduce the time complexity by leveraging efficient element checking, which is done in constant time for an unordered set.

To implement this, we use two sets: elementsInA and elementsInB. These sets store the elements encountered up to the current index. For each index currentIndex, we insert the current elements of both A[currentIndex] and B[currentIndex] into their respective sets. Then, we iterate over the elements in elementsInA and check if each element exists in elementsInB. If it does, it is counted as a common element.
Algorithm

    Initialize n as the size of array A.

    Create a prefixCommonArray array of size n to store the result.

    Initialize two unordered sets elementsInA and elementsInB to track the elements encountered in arrays A and B respectively.

    Iterate through each currentIndex from 0 to n-1:

        Add the element A[currentIndex] to elementsInA.

        Add the element B[currentIndex] to elementsInB.

        Initialize commonCount to 0, which will track the number of common elements in elementsInA and elementsInB.

        Iterate through each element in elementsInA:
            If the element exists in elementsInB, increment commonCount.

        Set prefixCommonArray[currentIndex] to commonCount.

    Return prefixCommonArray, which contains the common count for each prefix of A and B.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let n be the size of the input arrays A and B.

    Time complexity: O(n2)

    The outer loop runs n times (from currentIndex = 0 to currentIndex = n-1). Inside the loop, the insert operation for the set takes O(1) on average. The inner loop iterates over the elements in elementsInA, which can have up to currentIndex + 1 elements (at most n elements). For each element, the count operation in elementsInB also takes O(1) on average. Therefore, the inner loop contributes O(n) per iteration of the outer loop.

    Overall, the time complexity is O(n)×O(n)=O(n2).

    Space complexity: O(n)

    The space complexity is dominated by the two set objects, elementsInA and elementsInB, which can each store up to n elements. This results in O(n) space. The output container (prefixCommonArray) is excluded from the analysis as it is part of the problem statement, and the remaining variables use O(1) space.

Approach 3: Single Pass with Frequency Array
Intuition

We can further optimize the approach by using a frequency array to count how many times each number appears in the two arrays, A and B. The key idea is to avoid unnecessary nested loops or set-based checks by directly counting the occurrences of each number in both arrays up to the current index.

We maintain a frequency array of size n + 1. This array is used to store the count of each element's occurrence across both A and B. Since the elements in A and B are permutations of numbers from 1 to n, the frequency array has n + 1 elements to cover the range from 1 to n (ignoring index 0 for simplicity).

As we process each index currentIndex of both arrays, we increment the count of A[currentIndex] and B[currentIndex] in the frequency array. Whenever the count for an element in the frequency array reaches 2 (meaning that this number has appeared once in both A and B), we know that this element is a common element at the current prefix, and we increment the commonCount.

Finally, we store the commonCount at each index in the prefixCommonArray, which will give us the cumulative count of common elements at each position in the arrays. This way we only visit each element a constant number of times, making it more efficient than the two previous approaches.

The algorithm is visualized below:

Current
Algorithm

    Initialize an integer n to store the size of array A.

    Create a prefixCommonArray array of size n to store the result.

    Create a frequency array of size n + 1 to keep track of the occurrences of each number.

    Initialize commonCount to 0, which will store the count of common elements in prefixes of A and B.

    Iterate through each index currentIndex from 0 to n - 1:
        Increment the frequency of A[currentIndex] and check if its count becomes 2, indicating a common element between A and B. If true, increment commonCount.
        Similarly, increment the frequency of B[currentIndex] and check if its count becomes 2. If true, increment commonCount.
        Assign the value of commonCount to prefixCommonArray[currentIndex].

    Return prefixCommonArray, which contains the common count for each prefix of A and B.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let n be the size of the input arrays A and B.

    Time complexity: O(n)

    The loop runs n times (from currentIndex = 0 to currentIndex = n - 1). Inside the loop, the operations involve incrementing the frequency of elements in A and B and checking if the frequency equals 2. These operations are O(1) because they involve simple array accesses and comparisons.

    Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n).

    Space complexity: O(n)

    The space complexity is dominated by the frequency array, which requires O(n+1)=O(n) space. The output container (prefixCommonArray) is excluded from the analysis as it is part of the problem statement, and the remaining variables use O(1) space.
