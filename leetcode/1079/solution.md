Solution
Approach 1: Recursion
Intuition
Let's think about how we naturally form different sequences from a set of letters. Imagine we have Scrabble tiles with the letters 'A', 'A', and 'B'. How would we manually find all possible sequences? We would likely start with single letters ("A", "B"), then try two-letter combinations ("AA", "AB"), and finally three-letter combinations ("AAB").

A point to note in this manual process is that at each step, we make a choice about whether to use each available letter. For example, when starting with "AAB", we first decide: "Should I use the first 'A'?" If we use it, we then face the same type of decision with our remaining letters. If we don't use it, we still have all our letters available for future choices.

This decision-making pattern, where each choice reduces the problem to a smaller version of itself and follows a repetitive structure, naturally suggests a recursive approach. At each level of the recursion (or decision point), we have two options: either use an available letter and continue exploring, or skip it and move to the next letter.

The diagram below illustrates the structure of a recursion tree for this problem:



However, there's a subtle complexity we need to address. Consider the input "AAB" again. If we're not careful, we might count the same sequence multiple times because we have duplicate letters. For instance, we could form "AB" by using either the first or second 'A'.

To solve this, we’ll store all the sequences we generate in a hash set. Hash sets allow for quick lookups and keep the characters unique due to the set property, so we can check whether a particular sequence has already been found.

Let's create a recursive function generateSequences which creates all possible letter sequences. We'll also maintain a boolean array used of size equal to that of tiles. Each index in used tells us whether the character at that index in tiles has been used in the current sequence or not.

The first step in the recursive function is to add the current sequence to the hash set. This is because all intermediate sequences are also valid combinations and not just the ones where we use all the tiles. Next, we’ll iterate over each character in tiles. If a character hasn’t been used yet, we’ll add it to the current sequence and recurse. After exploring that path, we’ll backtrack and mark the letter as unused to allow us to try different combinations.

We start the recursion by calling the function with an empty string. When the recursion completes, the hash set will contain all possible letter combinations. Finally, we return the size of the hash set minus one, since the problem asks for non-empty sequences only.

For a more comprehensive understanding of hash tables, check out the Hash Table Explore Card. This resource provides an in-depth look at hash tables, explaining their key concepts and applications with a variety of problems to solidify understanding of the pattern.

Algorithm
Initialize:
a hash set called sequences to store the unique sequences.
a variable len to store the length of the input string tiles.
Create a boolean array used of size len to track the used characters
Call the recursive helper function generateSequences with the initial parameters: tiles, an empty string, used array, and the sequences set.
Return the size of the sequences set minus 1 (to exclude the empty string).
Helper method generateSequences(tiles, current, used, sequences):

Add the current sequence to the sequences set.
Initialize a loop that runs from position 0 to the length of tiles. For each position:
Check if the character at the current position is not used. If not used:
Mark the current position as used in the used array.
Make a recursive call with: tiles, current string + character at the current position, used array, and sequences set.
After the recursive call returns, mark the current position as unused (backtrack).
When the loop ends, return to the previous recursive call.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the length of the input string tiles.

Time complexity: O(n⋅n!)

The time complexity is determined by two main factors. First, for each position, we have at most n choices (in the first level of recursion). At each subsequent level, we have one less choice as characters get used. This creates a pattern similar to n⋅(n−1)⋅(n−2)⋅...⋅1, which is n!. Additionally, at each step, we perform string concatenation which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n⋅n!).

Space complexity: O(n⋅n!)

The space complexity has multiple components. First, the recursion stack can go up to depth n, using O(n) space. The set sequences will store all possible unique sequences. For a string of length n, we can have sequences of length 1 to n, and each sequence can be made from n possible characters (with repetition allowed). This means the hash set can store up to O(n!) sequences, and each sequence can be of length O(n). Therefore, the total space complexity is O(n⋅n!).

Approach 2: Optimized Recursion
Intuition
Imagine we're playing with Scrabble tiles again, but this time we have the string "AAABBC". We can make an important observation here: what really matters isn't the position of each letter, but rather how many of each letter we have available. Whether we use the first 'A' or the second 'A' doesn't change the sequences we can create - we just need to know we have three 'A's to work with.

This insight leads us to our first key decision: instead of tracking individual letters, we can track the frequency of each letter. Think of it like having separate piles for each letter - three tiles in the 'A' pile, two in the 'B' pile, and one in the 'C' pile. To implement this, we can maintain an array charCount where each index represents a letter (0 for 'A', 1 for 'B', etc.), and the value represents how many of that letter we have.

Now, let's think about how we build sequences using these frequency counts. At each step, we're asking ourselves: "Which letter should I add to my current sequence?" We can loop over all 26 letters and use any letter that still has a positive count. This is fundamentally different from our previous approach where we were making yes/no decisions about each position in tiles.

This incremental building of the sequence using the remaining letters suggests a recursive approach. We'll pass charCount to the recursive function and start building the sequence by eliminating each available character one by one. Remember that we also need to count all intermediate sequences (where charCount is not empty yet), because these are also valid letter tile possibilities.

Notice that nowhere in our algorithm do we work with the actual sequence itself. Each unique sequence is determined by the number of letters available in charCount, not the sequence. This means we no longer need to maintain a hash set to store visited sequences, saving significant space.

Our main function calls the recursive method with the full charCount array. The result returned by it is our required answer.

Algorithm
Initialize an integer array charCount of size 26 to store the frequency of each uppercase letter.
Iterate through each character of tiles:
Increment the count at the index (character - 'A') in the charCount array.
Call the recursive helper function findSequences with the charCount array.
Return the result from findSequences.
Helper method findSequences(charCount):

Initialize a variable totalCount to 0 to track the number of possible sequences.
Start a loop that runs from position 0 to 25 (for 26 letters):
Check if the count of the current character is 0. If true:
Skip to the next iteration.
If not 0:
Increment totalCount by 1 (counting the current character as a sequence).
Decrement the count of the current character in the charCount array.
Make a recursive call with the updated charCount array.
Add the result of the recursive call to totalCount.
Increment the count of the current character back (backtrack).
Return totalCount.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the length of the input string tiles.

Time complexity: O(2 
n
 )

The time complexity comes from the fact that for each character in the input string, we have two choices: either use it in our sequence or not. At each recursive call, we try all remaining characters, but since we're using frequency counting, duplicate characters are handled automatically. For an input string of length n, the recursion tree will have a branching factor equal to the number of unique characters still available and can go up to depth n. This leads to a time complexity of O(2 
n
 ).

Space complexity: O(n)

The space complexity has two parts. First, the fixed-size array charCount takes O(1) space as it always has 26 elements regardless of input size. Second, the recursion stack can go up to depth n as each recursive call uses one character.

Therefore, the total space complexity is O(n).

Approach 3: Permutations and Combinations
Intuition
Consider a sequence "ABC". Generating it actually has two steps:

Choosing the three tiles 'A', 'B', and 'C'.
Arranging them in order to form "ABC".
Notice that after step 1, we can create 5 more sequences: "BAC", "CBA", "BCA", "ACB", and "CAB." These are all the permutations of "ABC".

The total number of permutations that can be generated from n unique characters is n!. For the characters 'A', 'B', and 'C', the number of unique characters is 3, so 6 sequences can be generated from them.

However, we need to account for cases where there are multiple occurrences of the same character. For example, consider the tiles 'A', 'A', and 'B'. This will generate only 3 unique sequences of length 3: "AAB", "ABA", and "BAA". This is because swapping the first and second 'A' doesn’t create a new sequence, so they can’t be counted separately.

To account for this, we modify our formula to the following: if we have 3 characters with frequencies n 
1
​
 , n 
2
​
 , and n 
3
​
 , the number of 3 length sequences are:

(n 
1
​
 )!⋅(n 
2
​
 )!⋅(n 
3
​
 )!
(n 
1
​
 +n 
2
​
 +n 
3
​
 )!
​
 
​
 
The above formula can be extended to m characters of different frequencies.

So now, our task is to generate all combinations of characters from the given tiles. We can use a recursive method to do this. The function iterates over the tiles string and makes two choices at each step: whether to pick the current character or not. This generates all possible combinations of characters, which we then pass to a helper method called countPermutations.

The countPermutations method counts the frequency of each character in the generated combination using an array called charCount (similar to the previous approach). It then applies the formula above to calculate all possible permutations of the current combination.

The total permutations for each combination are returned by the recursive function. The cumulative sum of all such combinations is our final answer, which we return at the end.

Algorithm
Initialize a hash set seen to store unique sequences.
Convert seen to a sorted string sortedTiles.
Call the recursive helper function generateSequences with initial parameters. Subtract 1 from the result and return it.
Helper method factorial(n):

Check if n is less than or equal to 1:
If true, return 1.
Initialize a variable result to 1.
Loop num from 2 to n:
Multiply the result by num.
Return the final result.
Helper method countPermutations(seq):

Initialize an integer array charCount of size 26 for character frequencies.
Iterate through each character in the input seq:
Increment the count at index (character - 'A') in charCount.
Set a variable total as the factorial of the length of seq.
Divide the total by the factorial of each character's frequency in charCount.
Return the final total.
Helper method generateSequences(tiles, current, pos, seen):

Check if the current pos has reached the length of tiles. If true and the current sequence is new (added to seen set):
Return the number of permutations for the current sequence.
If true but the sequence is already seen:
Return 0.
Make two recursive calls and sum their results:
One excluding the current character (same sequence, next position).
One including the current character (sequence + current character, next position).
Return the sum of both recursive calls.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the length of the input string tiles.

Time complexity: O(2 
n
 ⋅n)

The time complexity is determined by several components:

The initial sorting takes O(nlogn) time.
In the generateSequences function, we create a binary recursion tree where at each position we have two choices (include or exclude), leading to 2 
n
  possible sequences. For each unique sequence, we calculate permutations which involves iterating over the sequence (O(n)) and performing factorial calculations (O(n)).
The factorial calculations themselves are O(n) as they iterate from 1 to at most n.
Therefore, the dominant factor is generating and processing all possible sequences, giving us a time complexity of O(2 
n
 ⋅n).

Space complexity: O(2 
n
 ⋅n)

The space complexity also has multiple components.

The recursion stack can go up to depth n, using O(n) space.
The hash set seen stores unique combinations of characters. In the worst case, with all distinct characters, we could have 2 
n
  different combinations as each character can either be included or excluded. Each sequence in the set can be up to length n. So, the set uses O(2 
n
 ⋅n) space.
The charCount array in countPermutations is constant space O(1) as it's always size 26.
Thus, the dominant factor is the space needed for storing unique sequences in the seen set, making the total space complexity O(2 
n
 ⋅n).
