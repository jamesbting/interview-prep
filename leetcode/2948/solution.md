Solution
Overview
We are given an array nums in which we can swap any two elements nums[i] and nums[j] if their absolute difference is less than or equal to limit. We want to find the lexicographically smallest possible array we can make by applying this swap operation an unlimited number of times on nums.

Lexicographical order compares arrays element by element, starting from the leftmost index. For two arrays, the comparison stops as soon as we find an index where the elements differ:

The array with the smaller element at this differing index is considered smaller.
If all elements are the same up to the shorter array's length, the shorter array is considered smaller.
For the example arrays given in the problem description, [2,10,3] and [10,2,3], the first elements don't match: 2 < 10, so [2,10,3] is lexicographically smaller.

Let's look at another example: For [1, 1, 3, 5] and [1, 1, 2, 7, 9], the first occurrence in which the elements do not match is at index 2: 2 < 3 so [1, 1, 2, 7, 9] is lexicographically smaller.

Approach: Sorting + Grouping
Intuition
Our goal is to perform valid swap operations on nums so that it is as lexicographically small as possible. After looking at the examples in the overview, we see that to make a lexicographically small array, we would like smaller values to be more towards the front, while larger values are pushed to the back. We will now investigate what sort of rearrangements are possible in order to achieve this ordering.

Consider the array [5, 3, 1] with limit = 2:

1 and 3 can be swapped because ∣3−1∣=2≤limit.
Similarly, 3 and 5 can be swapped because ∣5−3∣=2≤limit.
On the other hand, 1 and 5 cannot be swapped directly because ∣5−1∣=4>limit.
Even though 1 and 5 cannot be swapped directly, we notice that they can effectively be swapped through a chain of intermediate swaps where 1 gets swapped with 3 and 3 gets swapped with 5:

Reordering

In other words, this swapping is transitive: If a can swap with b, and b can swap with c, then a can effectively be swapped with c. Through this transitive property, we know that all elements in the example array can be swapped with each other (because they all belong in this transitive swapping chain). Because of this, any rearrangement/permutation can also be done. For this problem, we want the elements in increasing order to achieve the smallest lexicographic value, so we know [1, 3, 5] is the lexicographically smallest possible array that can be made.

Now that we know about this transitive property, it would be useful to see which elements in nums can be rearranged together like shown above. Specifically, we want to organize nums into groups, so that all elements in a given group can participate in this transitive chaining and can thus be reordered in our desired increasing order.

To do this, we can first sort nums in increasing order. We can then iterate through each num in nums and compare it to its previous element to see if their absolute difference is within limit. If it is, then num belongs in the same running group. Otherwise, the chain is broken and a new group containing num is created.

Sorting and grouping

To keep track of groups, we can use a hash map numToGroup, where the key is the element and the value is the group number (the group number can be initialized to 0 and incremented each time a new group is created). Similarly, to keep track of the list of elements comprising each group, we can use another hash map groupToList where the key is the group number and the value is the sorted list of elements belonging to the group.

After this process, we now know what group each element in nums belongs to, and that elements in each group can be freely rearranged:

Grouping in original input

Once we've grouped the elements, we return to the original array. For each element, we check its group using numToGroup and overwrite it with the next smallest element from that group. This ensures the elements in each group are placed in ascending order, resulting in the smallest possible lexicographic arrangement.

Final output

Algorithm
Create a sorted copy of the input array nums called numsSorted.

Initialize variables:

currGroup to track the current group index.
numToGroup, a map to associate each number with its group.
groupToList, a map to associate each group with a list of numbers that belong to it.
Sort the numsSorted array.

Assign the first element of numsSorted to group 0:

Add the element to groupToList under group 0.
Iterate through the rest of numsSorted:

If the difference between the current element and the previous one is greater than limit, increment currGroup (indicating a new group).
Assign the current element to the correct group in numToGroup.
Add the element to the corresponding list in groupToList.
Iterate through the original nums array:

For each element, retrieve its group from numToGroup.
Replace the element with the next element from its corresponding group in groupToList.
Return the modified nums array, which is now the lexicographically smallest array after applying the group-wise sorting.

Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let N be the size of nums.

Time Complexity: O(N⋅logN)

Sorting nums takes O(N⋅logN) time. Iterating through each element in sortedNums and updating our two maps takes O(N) time. Iterating through nums to overwrite its values with the sorted list values in each group takes a total of O(N) time. Thus, the total time complexity is O(N⋅logN).

Space Complexity: O(N+S 
N

 )≈O(N)

Both our maps have a space complexity of N. The space complexity used for sorting nums depends on the language of implementation:

In Java, Arrays.sort() is implemented using a variant of the Quick Sort algorithm which has a space complexity of O(logN).
In C++, the sort() function is implemented as a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort, with a worst-case space complexity of O(logN).
In Python, the sort() method sorts a list using the Timsort algorithm which is a combination of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort and has a space complexity of O(N).

Thus, the total space complexity is O(N+S
