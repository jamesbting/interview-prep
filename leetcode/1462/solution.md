Solution
Overview
We are given a directed graph representing course dependencies. The graph consists of numCourses nodes (denoted as N for simplicity) and E directed edges, where each edge is represented as a pair (u, v). An edge (u, v) indicates that course u is a prerequisite for course v.

Additionally, we are given Q queries. Each query is a pair (u, v), and the goal is to determine if course u is a prerequisite for course v. The answer to each query should be true if u is a prerequisite of v, and false otherwise.

Approach 1: Tree Traversal - On Demand
Intuition
We can simplify the problem by recognizing that the answer to the query (u, v) is true if there exists a path from node u to node v. This is because the edges are directed to represent dependencies, so if we can reach node v from node u, it indicates that node u is a prerequisite for node v.

This relationship is an example of transitive closure. For instance, consider a path with three nodes: u -> v -> w. In this case:

Node u is a prerequisite for node v
Node v is a prerequisite for node w. By transitivity, we can conclude that node u is also a prerequisite for node w.
Therefore, the problem reduces to determining whether there exists a path between two nodes. To solve this, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the graph. Alternatively, other traversal methods like Breadth-First Search (BFS) can also be used. In this approach, we begin at node u and explore its adjacent nodes recursively until we reach node v. If we find node v during the traversal, we return true. If we exhaust all possible paths without reaching node v, we return false.

To efficiently track visited nodes and prevent revisiting them, we maintain a visited array. This array is reset for each query to ensure that each DFS traversal starts with a clean slate, avoiding interference from previous queries.

Algorithm
Define a function isPrerequisite that takes the adjacency list of the graph, a visited array, and two nodes src and target, and returns whether a path exists from src to target:

Mark the current node src as visited.
If src is the same as target, return true (we found the path).
For each neighboring node adj of src:
If adj has not been visited yet, recursively call the DFS to check if a path exists from adj to target.
Return the true if the result of at least one recursive call is true and false otherwise.
Create the adjacency list adjList using the prerequisite pairs [u, v].

For each query [u, v], check if there is a path from u to v using DFS:

Initialize a visited array with all entries as false
Call the isPrerequisite function to check if there exists a path from u to v.
Store the result for each query in a result list answer.
Return answer.

Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let N be the number of courses (numCourses) and let Q be the size of the queries list. In the worst case, the size of the prerequisites list can grow up to  
2
N⋅(N−1)
​
 , when every course is a prerequisite for every other course, forming a complete directed graph.

Time complexity: O(Q⋅N 
2
 ).

Creating the adjacency list adjList takes O(N 
2
 ) time as we need to iterate over the list prerequisites. Then we iterate over queries and for each we perform DFS that can take O(V+E) which is equivalent to O(N 
2
 ). Hence, the total time complexity equals O(Q⋅N 
2
 ).

Space complexity: O(N 
2
 )

The adjacency list requires O(N 
2
 ) as it stores every edge in the list prerequisites. For the DFS traversal, we need a visited array of size O(N) and the recursive stack for DFS calls requires O(N) space in the worsts case. Therefore, the total space complexity is equal to O(N 
2
 ).

Approach 2: Tree Traversal - Preprocessed
Intuition
This approach is similar to the previous one, where we traverse the graph to determine if there is a path from node u to node v. However, the key difference here is that instead of performing DFS/BFS for each query, we precompute the reachability for all nodes. Specifically, for each node i in the range from 0 to N - 1, we perform BFS (can do DFS as well) to identify all nodes that can be reached from i and store this information in a 2D array isPrerequisite.

A value of isPrerequisite[u][v] = true indicates that node u is a prerequisite for node v. During the BFS, starting from node i, we mark all nodes adj in the path as isPrerequisite[i][adj] = true, signifying that i is a prerequisite for adj. In the BFS process, instead of using a separate visited array, we will just use an isPrerequisite array. This is because if isPrerequisite[i][adj] is true, then we can deduce that adj is already visited and skip it.

This method is particularly useful when the number of queries is much larger than the number of nodes. In contrast to the previous approach, where we performed DFS/BFS for each query, this method allows for constant-time query answers since the reachability information has already been preprocessed and stored.

Algorithm
Construct an adjacency list adjList from the prerequisites list where each course points to the courses that depend on it.

Preprocessing (BFS from each node):

For each node i (from 0 to N - 1):
Start a BFS from i to explore all reachable nodes.

Repeat the following while the queue is not empty:

Pop the front in the queue as node.
Iterate over the adjacent node and if the node i is not already marked as its prerequisite, mark it and add node to the queue.
For each query [u, v] return isPrerequisite[u][v].

Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let N be the number of courses (numCourses) and let Q be the size of the queries list. In the worst case, the size of the prerequisites list can grow up to  
2
N⋅(N−1)
​
 , when every course is a prerequisite for every other course, forming a complete directed graph.

Time complexity: O(N 
3
 +Q).

Creating the adjacency list adjList requires O(N 
2
 ) time, as we need to iterate over the prerequisites list. Next, we perform BFS starting from each of the N nodes. Each BFS traversal takes O(N 
2
 ) in the worst case, as the time complexity of BFS is O(V+E). Therefore, the total preprocessing is O(N⋅N 
2
 )=O(N 
3
 ).

To answer each query, we can retrieve results in constant time from a precomputed map, so answering all Q queries takes O(Q) time. Thus, the total time complexity will be O(N 
3
 +Q).

Space complexity: O(N 
2
 )

The adjacency list takes O(N 
2
 ) space as it will store every edge in the list prerequisites. For BFS, we need a 2D array isPrerequisite with size O(N 
2
 ) to store the answer for every pair of nodes. The queue required for the BFS will take O(N) size for each node, hence the total space complexity is equal to O(N 
2
 ).

Approach 3: Topological Sort - Kahn's Algorithm
Intuition
We need to find a way to process nodes in the correct order, ensuring that each node is processed only after its dependencies are handled. This is where topological sorting comes into play. Kahn’s algorithm is a great fit for this task because it respects the dependencies of each node, ensuring nodes are only visited once their prerequisites are completed.

Topological sorting is an algorithm used in directed graphs to arrange nodes such that for every directed edge from node u to node v, node u comes before v. This is a natural approach when dealing with dependencies, like in project scheduling, task ordering, or handling prerequisites.

Now, to adapt Kahn's algorithm to our needs, we need to keep track of a node’s prerequisites. Instead of just processing nodes in topological order, we'll modify the algorithm to maintain a list of dependencies for each node. As we move from node u to node v, we’ll add all of u's prerequisites to v's prerequisites. This is important because it computes the transitive closure, meaning we’re not just tracking immediate dependencies, but also indirect ones.

By the end of this process, each node will have a complete list of all nodes that must be visited before it. With this setup, when we need to answer a query (u, v), all we have to do is check if u is in the list of prerequisites for v.

The general structure of Kahn’s algorithm stays the same. We start by calculating the indegree of each node, which tells us how many nodes depend on it. Nodes with an indegree of zero are independent and can be processed first, so we enqueue them. Then, using a queue, we dequeue nodes, process their neighbors, update the prerequisite lists, and enqueue any neighbors whose indegree drops to zero. This continues until we’ve processed all nodes, ensuring the correct order of traversal.

Current


Algorithm
Create an adjacency list (adjList) to store the directed graph representing course dependencies.

Initialize an array (indegree) to track the number of prerequisites (in-degree) for each course.

Iterate over the prerequisites array to populate the adjacency list and update the indegree for each course.

Initialize a queue (q) to process courses with zero in-degree (no prerequisites).

While the queue is not empty:

Dequeue a course (node).
For each adjacent course (adj) in the adjacency list of nodes, add the prerequisites of node to the list nodePrerequisites[adj].
Decrement the in-degree of the node adj, and if the in-degree becomes zero, enqueue it for further processing.
For each query (u, v), check if course u is in the prerequisite list of course v by checking nodePrerequisites[v].

Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let N be the number of courses (numCourses) and let Q be the size of the queries list. In the worst case, the size of the prerequisites list can grow up to  
2
N⋅(N−1)
​
 , when every course is a prerequisite for every other course, forming a complete directed graph.

Time complexity: O(N 
3
 +Q).

Creating the adjacency list adjList takes O(N 
2
 ) time as we need to iterate over the list prerequisites. The array indegree will be of size O(N). In Kahn's algorithm, we iterate over each node and edge of the vertex which is O(N 
2
 ) and for each edge traversed we will also add the prerequisites to the next node which is another O(N). To answer each query we need constant time to retrieve from the map and hence it's O(Q) to answer all queries. Hence, the total time complexity equals O(N 
3
 +Q).

Space complexity: O(N 
2
 )

List adjList takes O(N 
2
 ) as it will store every edge in the list prerequisites. Array indegree will take O(N) space and the queue for Kahn's algorithm will also be O(N) size. Map nodePrerequisites will be from the node to its prerequisites and thus the total number of entries can be equal to O(N 
2
 ). Hence the total space complexity equals O(N 
2
 ).

Approach 4: Floyd Warshall Algorithm
Intuition
In the first approach, we discussed the concept of transitive closure, which simplified the problem. The key insight was that the transitive closure allows us to determine if a path exists between two nodes, even indirectly. This concept is central to solving the All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) problem, for which the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is commonly used. This algorithm works by systematically considering every possible intermediate node and checking if a path between two nodes can be improved by going through that intermediate node. It then updates the shortest distance between the nodes.

For our problem, however, we don't need to calculate the shortest path, just whether a path exists. This leads us to a simple modification of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm: instead of keeping track of distances, we’ll use boolean values to represent whether a path exists between two nodes.

The main idea is to check if there’s a path from src to target by looking at all possible intermediate nodes. For each intermediate node, we check if there’s a path from src to that node and a path from that node to target. If both conditions hold, then we can confirm that a path exists between src and target. We then set isPrerequisite[src][target] to true.

At the end of this process, we’ll have a 2D array, isPrerequisite, where each entry isPrerequisite[u][v] tells us whether u is a prerequisite for v.

Algorithm
Initialize a 2D boolean array isPrerequisite of size numCourses x numCourses to track direct prerequisite relationships between courses.

Populate the isPrerequisite matrix based on the prerequisites:

For each pair in prerequisites, mark isPrerequisite[edge[0]][edge[1]] as true to indicate that edge[0] is a prerequisite for edge[1].
Compute transitive closure of the prerequisite relationships using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm:
For each possible intermediate course intermediate:
For each source course src:
For each target course target:
Update isPrerequisite[src][target] to include indirect relationships:
If src can reach intermediate and intermediate can reach target, then src can reach target.
Initialize an empty list answer to store the results of the queries.

For each query in queries:

Add the value of isPrerequisite[query[0]][query[1]] to the answer list, indicating whether query[0] is a prerequisite for query[1].
Return the answer list containing the results for all queries.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let N be the number of courses (numCourses) and let Q be the size of the queries list. In the worst case, the size of the prerequisites list can grow up to  
2
N⋅(N−1)
​
 , when every course is a prerequisite for every other course, forming a complete directed graph.

Time complexity: O(N 
3
 +Q).

We iterate over each node in three nested loops, so this step takes O(N 
3
 ). To answer each query we need constant time to retrieve from the map and hence it's O(Q) to answer all queries. Hence, the total time complexity equals O(N 
3
 +Q).

Space complexity: O(N 
2
 )

We need a 2D array isPrerequisite with size O(N 
2
 ) to store the answer for every pair of nodes, hence the total space complexity is equal to O(N 
2
 ).
