Solution
Overview
We are given a directed graph with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each node has at most one outgoing edge given by edges.

Our task is to return the length of the longest cycle in the graph. If no cycle exists, we need to return -1.

Approach 1: Depth First Search
Intuition
The problem specifies that each node has no more than one outgoing edge. Let's see what kinds of graphs we can create with this.

Let us consider a node node which belongs to a cycle. It would imply that the only outgoing edge of node would also be in this cycle. As a result, node cannot be a part of any other cycle because it only has one outgoing edge, which is consumed in this cycle. This demonstrates that in a graph with only one outgoing edge, a node cannot be a part of more than one cycle.

We would visit all the nodes in the cycle if we started a graph traversal from any node in the cycle. There is no point in revisiting the nodes in the cycle because they cannot be part of any other cycle.

Also, there is also no point in visiting the nodes that do not form a cycle again. We would have iterated over the only outgoing edge (if they have) during the first visit and there is no point in iterating over it again.

This implies that visiting each node only once is sufficient.

Let us now calculate the length of any formed cycle. We begin a depth-first search traversal (DFS) from an unvisited node, node1, and iterate over the outgoing edge to go to neighbor, from neighbor to its neighbor, and so on. During the traversal, we keep track of the distance from node1 while visiting each node. To store the distances, we can use a hash map dist.

As we traverse the graph, suppose we need to return to node2 from node3 (there is an edge node3 -> node2) which has already been visited in this DFS traversal. It denotes the existence of a cycle. dist[node3] - dist[node2] would give us the number of edges from node2 to node3 because we kept track of distance from the starting node node1. We also need to add one for the node3 -> node2 edge that completes the cycle. As a result, this cycle would be dist[node3] - dist[node2] + 1 in length. This brings us to our solution.

We create a answer variable and initialize it to -1. We iterate over all the nodes and if the current node, node, is not visited, we start a DFS traversal. For each DFS traversal, we also create a new hash map dist and set dist[node] = 0.

In the DFS traversal, we check the neighbor of node using neighbor = edges[node]. If neighbor is not visited, we update dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1 and recursively perform the DFS traversal starting with neighbor.

If neighbor is already visited, one of two things can happen. It is either a cycle formation or neighbor was visited in a previous DFS traversal and not the current DFS traversal. This can be verified if the dist map has the key neighbor in it (we create a new map for every traversal).

If dist contains neighbor, it means we visited neighbor during the current DFS traversal itself and it is a formation of cycle. We update answer = max(answer, dist[node] - dist[neighbor] + 1 in this case.

Otherwise, if dist does not contains neighbor, it means that neighbor was visited in a previous DFS traversal. As previously discussed, there is no point in returning to a node.

We would have our answer in answer after visiting all of the nodes.

Algorithm
Initialize an integer answer = -1. This would store the length of the longest cycle in the graph.
Initialize another integer n = edges.length which stores the number of nodes in the graph.
Create a visit array of length n to keep track of nodes that have been visited.
Iterate through all of the nodes and for each node i check if it is visited or not. If node i is not visited, create a hash map dist where dist.get(x) would store the distance of node x from starting node i. Begin the DFS traversal:
We use the dfs function to perform the traversal. For each call, pass node, edges, dist and visit as the parameters. We start with node i.
Mark node as visited and get its neighbor neighbor using edges[node].
If neighbor exists and is not visited, we update dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1 and recursively call dfs passing neighbor as the node.
Otherwise, if neighbor exists and is already visited, we check if it is present in dist. If it is present, it is a formation of cycle. We perform answer = max(answer, dist[node] - dist[neighbor] + 1). Otherwise, if it not present in dist, we ignore it as it was visited in a previous DFS traversal.
Return answer.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Here n is the number of nodes.

Time complexity: O(n).

Initializing the visit array takes O(n) time.
The dfs function visits each node once, which takes O(n) time in total. Because we have directed edges, each edge will be iterated once, resulting in O(n) operations in total while visiting all the nodes.
Each operation on the dist map takes O(1) time. Because we insert a distance for each node when it is visited, it will take O(n) time to insert distances for all of the nodes. It is also used to check the formation of a cycle when a previously visited node is encountered again. Because there are n nodes, it can be checked at most n times. It would also take O(n) time in that case.
Space complexity: O(n).

The visit array takes O(n) space.
The recursion call stack used by dfs can have no more than n elements in the worst-case scenario. It would take up O(n) space in that case.
The dist map can also have no more than n elements and hence it would take up O(n) space as well.
Approach 2: Kahn's Algorithm
Intuition
We can also think to solve this problem using a topological sort strategy. A topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge u -> v from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.

In a directed acyclic graph, we can use Kahn's algorithm to get the topological ordering. Kahn’s algorithm works by keeping track of the number of incoming edges into each node (indegree). It works by repeatedly visiting the nodes with an indegree of zero and deleting all the edges associated with it leading to a decrement of indegree for the nodes whose incoming edges are deleted. This process continues until no element with zero indegree can be found.

If you are not familiar with Kahn's algorithm, we suggest you read our Leetcode Explore Card.

Let's perform Kahn's algorithm on directed graph having two cycle. Here's a visual step-by-step represenntation of how it would work:

We can see that if there is a cycle, there is no way of making the indegree of nodes in the cycle to 0 due to the cyclic dependency. We cannot visit nodes in the cycle.

Because each node can only have one outgoing edge, no node in the cycle can have an outgoing edge to a node that is not in the cycle. The only outoging edge of a node in the cycle would be consumed by the cycle itself. This means that there would be no other node that would not be visited because of the unvisited nodes in the cycle. As a result, all the nodes not in the cycle would be visited and only the nodes in the cycle would be not visited using this algorithm.

After completing Kahn's algorithm, we iterate over all the unvisited nodes to determine the length of the longest cycle. For an unvisited node node, we begin by traversing from node to its neighbor using edge[node], then to its neighbor, and so on, until we return to node. We keep track of the number of nodes in the cycle (the number of nodes in the cycle equals the length of the cycle) and mark all of the nodes in this cycle as visited so that we don't visit them again. From all the formed cycles, we chose the one with the longest cycle length.

If all of the nodes are visited during Kahn's algorithm, the graph has no cycle.

Algorithm
Initialize an integer n = edges.length which stores the number of nodes in the graph.
Create an array indegree of length n where indegree[X] stores the number of edges with one end at node X.
Create a visit array of length n to keep track of nodes that have been visited.
Initialize a queue of integers q and start a BFS algorithm moving from the leaf nodes to the parent nodes.
Begin the BFS traversal by pushing all of the leaf nodes (indegree equal to 0) in the queue.
While the queue is not empty;
Dequeue the first node from the queue.
Mark node as visited.
Get the neighbor, neighbor, of node using edges[node]. If neighbor != -1, we decrement indegree[neighbor] by 1.
If indegree[neighbor] == 0, it means that neighbor behaves as a leaf node, so we push neighbor in the queue.
Iterate over unvisited nodes and for an unvisited node i:
Mark node i as visited.
Fetch neighbor, neighbor, of i using edge[i] and create a variable count to count number of nodes in the cycle. Initialize count = 1 to count node i itself.
Keep moving forward in the cycle until we reach node i (neighbor != i). Mark neighbor as visited and move to next neighbor neighbor = edges[neighbor]. Also, increment count by 1 for each node that is being visited in the cycle.
Update answer = max(answer, count).
Return answer.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Here n is the number of nodes.

Time complexity: O(n).

Initializing the visit and indegree arrays take O(n) time each.
Each queue operation takes O(1) time, and a single node will be pushed once, leading to O(n) operations for n nodes. We iterate over the neighbor of each node that is popped out of the queue iterating over all the edges once. Since there are n edges at most, it would take O(n) time in total.
We iterate over all the nodes that are in the cycles. There cannot be more than n nodes in all the cycles combined, so it would take O(n) time.
Space complexity: O(n).

The visit and indegree arrays takes O(n) space each.
The queue can have no more than n elements in the worst-case scenario. It would take up O(n) space in that case.
