Solution
Approach 1: Custom Comparator
Intuition

A comparator is a tool used to define (or redefine) an order between two items of the same class or data type. Most languages allow for the use of a custom comparator. This means that we can define a rule that determines how an array is sorted, and leverage built-in sort functions for custom sort.

Recall that a comparator takes two values c1 and c2 as parameters and returns the following:

    If c1 comes before c2, return a negative integer.
    If c1 comes after c2, return a positive integer.
    If c1 and c2 are equal, return 0.

Letter c1 should come before c2 in the sorted order of s if and only if the index of c1 in the order string is less than the index of c2. By evaluating c1 and c2 as integer indices, we can use subtraction to achieve a return value that abides by the three rules described above.

Let's consider the following example: let s = "bdadeec" and order = "edcba". Letter "e" is at index 0 in order, whereas letter "b" is at index 3. Because 0<3, "e" should come before "b" in the result string. Therefore, the return result is 0−3=−3, a negative number that adheres to the first rule listed above.

Taking into account all possible relationships between pairs of letters, the result string is "eeddcba".
Algorithm

    Create a character array of input string s to allow modification.
    Use the built-in sort method and define the comparator function as the difference between the index of c1 and the index of c2 in order.
    Concatenate the character array into a string.
    Return this resulting string.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Here, we define N as the length of string s, and K as the length of string order.

    Time Complexity: O(NlogN)

    Sorting an array of length N requires O(NlogN) time, and the indices of order have to be retrieved for each distinct letter, which results in an O(NlogN+K) complexity. K is at most 26, the number of unique English letters, so we can simplify the time complexity to O(NlogN).

    Space Complexity: O(N) or O(log⁡N)

    Note that some extra space is used when we sort arrays in place. The space complexity of the sorting algorithm depends on the programming language.
        In Java, Arrays.sort() is implemented using a variant of the Quick Sort algorithm, which has a space complexity of O(logN) for sorting two arrays. The Java solution also uses an auxiliary array of length N. This is the dominating term for the Java solution.
        In C++, the sort() function is implemented as a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort, with a worse-case space complexity of O(log⁡N). This is the main space used by the C++ solution.

Approach 2: Frequency Table and Counting
Intuition

Because the order string already gives us the explicit ordering to sort all the letters, we can generate a sorted version of s without calling upon an O(NlogN) algorithm. Let's create a frequency table where the key equals a character c, and the value equals how many times c appears in the string s. Then, for each character in order, append the number of occurrences of that character in s to the resulting string. After iterating through order, any remaining characters in s can be appended to the end without disrupting the defined sorting order.

Let's look at an example: consider s = "leetcoded" and order = "ecolt", and result is initially an empty string.

Frequency Table:
character	l	e	t	c	o	d
frequency	1	3	1	1	1	2

    The first letter in order is "e", which appears 3 times in s, so result = "eee".
    The second letter in order is "c", which appears 1 times in s, so result = "eeec".
    The third letter in order is "o", which appears 1 times in s, so result = "eeeco".
    The fourth letter in order is "l", which appears 1 times in s, so result = "eeecol".
    The fifth letter in order is "t", which appears 1 times in s, so result = "eeecolt".

Finally, note that some letters in s could be missing in order, so we need to append any remaining letters to result. In this case, two occurrences of "d" need to be appended, so result = "eeecoltdd" is the final result.
Algorithm

    Initialize a frequency table (here we use a Hashmap, but a frequency array works too).
    Populate the frequency table by incrementing freq[letter] for each letter in s.
    For each character of order, append to result the same frequency it appears in s.
    Iterate through the frequency table to find any remaining letters of s not in order, and append these letters to result.
    Return the resulting string.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Here, we define N as the length of string s, and K as the length of string order.

    Time Complexity: O(N)

    It takes O(N) time to populate the frequency table, and all other hashmap operations performed take O(1) time in the average case. Building the result string also takes O(N) time because each letter from s is appended to the result in the custom order, making the overall time complexity O(N).

    Space Complexity: O(N)

    A hash map and a result string are created, which results in an additional space complexity of O(N).
