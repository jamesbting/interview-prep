Solution
Overview

We are given some packages with weights given in weights which must be shipped from one port to another. We have a ship that has some capacity, and it can ship packages (in the order given by weights) having a total weight less than or equal to its capacity each day.

Our task is to find the minimum capacity of the ship so that we can ship all the packages within days days.
Approach: Binary Search
Intuition

An intuitive approach would be to start with checking ship capacity equal to the largest weight in weights, say w. The ship's capacity cannot be smaller than w. We check if it is possible to ship all the packages within days days, using w as the capacity of the ship. If we are able to ship all the packages within the required days, we have w as our required answer.

Otherwise, we increment the capacity and try with w + 1. If we are able to ship the packages within the required days now, w + 1 is the answer. Otherwise, we try with the ship's capacity as w + 2.

How long can we go? In the worst case, we might need to choose the capacity of the ship equal to the sum of all the weights in weights and send them all in one day. So, our range starts from the largest weight and goes until the sum of the weights in weights.

This approach will provide the right answer to all the test cases but will indicate that the time limit has been exceeded. Because, in the worst case, we might need to check the ship's capacity from the largest weight to the sum of all elements in weights. The sum of all elements can reach n * 500, since 500 is the maximum weight we can have as per the problem constraints. So, we might need to check O(n⋅500) different values of ship capacity. For each capacity, we need to iterate over all the elements of weights to check whether we can ship the packages in the required number of days or not, this would require O(n) time. As a result, the total time required would be O(n⋅n⋅500)=O(n2⋅500) which would lead to TLE.

Let's think of a faster way by making some observations.

If we cannot ship the packages in the required days with capacity A, we can never ship packages with a capacity less than A. Also, if we can ship the packages in the required days with capacity B, we can always ship them with a capacity greater than B. So, in such a case, the optimal capacity lies between [A + 1, B] (both inclusive).

A scenario like this where our task is to search for an element X from a given range (L, R) where all values smaller than X do not satisfy a certain condition and all values greater than or equal to X satisfy it (or vice-versa), can be solved optimally with a binary search algorithm. In binary search, we repeatedly divide the solution space where the answer could be in half until the range contains just one element.

Here's how a typical binary search works:

Following the above discussion, we set the starting of the range to the largest weight in weights, say maxWeight and set the ending of the range to the sum of the elements of weights, say totalWeight. We define two variables, l = maxWeight and r = totalWeight to indicate the start and end of the range, respectively. Notice that the end of the range r is always a way to ship the elements within the required days.

Next, we find the middle of the range, mid = (l + r) / 2 and check if using mid capacity we can ship all the packages within days days.

    The problem's constraints allow us to use the formula mid = (l + r) / 2 without causing an overflow. Typically, in binary search, you should use the safe formula mid = l + (r - l) / 2 to avoid overflow.

If we are able to ship the packages with mid capacity within the required days, we know the answer is at most mid, so we can look for a better answer by moving to the lower half - change r = mid.

Otherwise, if we are not able to ship the packages with mid capacity, we cannot ship the packages with any capacity less than or equal to mid. So, we move to the upper half of the range by moving l = mid + 1.

To check whether we can ship all the packages with a given capacity, c, we create a method and define two variables in it, daysNeeded = 1 and currentLoad = 0 which store the total number of days needed to ship all the weights with c ship capacity and to keep track of how much weight has been placed in the ship on a day, respectively. We iterate over all the weights, and for each weight, we place the weight in the ship and increase its load to currentLoad = currentLoad + weight. We keep on placing the weights until currentLoad > c. If currentLoad exceeds capacity, we cannot keep adding weight and need an additional day. So, we increase the days needed to ship the packages by one, i.e., daysNeeded = daysNeeded + 1 we also set currentLoad = weight as this is the current load for the next day. Finally, if daysNeeded <= days, we return true. Otherwise, we return false.
Algorithm

    Initialize two integer variables, totalLoad and maxLoad. totalLoad stores the sum of all the elements of weights and maxLoad stores the largest element of weights.
    Create a method feasible which takes weights, c, days as the parameters and returns true if we can ship all the packages with c capacity.
    Perform a binary search over the range maxLoad to totalLoad.
        Create two variables, l and r, to represent the beginning and end of the range. Set l = maxLoad and r = totalLoad. We can always ship all the weights within days days with r capacity.
    Then, while l < r:
        Find the midpoint of the range (l, r) in the variable mid = (l + r) / 2.
        Call feasible(weights, mid, days) to see if we can ship all the weights in days days while using mid as the ship's capacity.
        If we can ship the packages with mid as the ship's capacity in less than or equal to days days, we move to the lower half of the range by setting r = mid.
        Otherwise, if we cannot ship the packages with m capacity in the required days, we move to the upper half of the range by setting l = mid + 1.
    Return l (or r) when l = r.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Here, n is the length of weights.

    Time complexity: O(n⋅log(500⋅n))=O(n⋅log(n))
        It takes O(n) time to iterate through weights to compute maxLoad and totalLoad.
        In the binary search algorithm, we divide our range by half every time. So for a range of length R, it performs O(log(R)) operations. In our case, the range is from maxLoad to totalLoad. As mentioned in the problem constraints, maxLoad can be 500, so the total load can be n * 500. So, in the worst case, the size of the range would be (n - 1) * 500 which would require O(log(500n−500))=O(log(n)) operations using a binary search algorithm.
        To see if we can deliver the packages in the required number of days with a specific capacity, we iterate through the weights array to see if the current capacity allows us to carry the all the packages in days days, which needs O(n) time.
        So it would take O(n⋅log(n)) time in total.

    Space complexity: O(1)
        We are only defining a few integer variables.
